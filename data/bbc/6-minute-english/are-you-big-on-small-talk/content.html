<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Hello, I&apos;m Neil. Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Rob.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, Neil.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>How are you today?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>I&apos;m fine, thanks. How are you?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>I&apos;m very well, actually. The weather has been nice lately, hasn&apos;t it?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Yes, it has. The winter has been mild this year but... according to the forecast there might be some snow in parts of the country next week... And, you know, that&apos;s good because I love snow and we haven&apos;t seen much of it for quite a while. It&apos;s only rain, isn&apos;t it I...<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK! OK! Enough! Enough now or they&apos;re going to think it&apos;s true that British people only talk about the weather!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Right.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>In this programme we&apos;re talking about conversation and how to start talking with people you don&apos;t know. In short: how to make <strong>small talk</strong>.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Right. Well, small talk is what we call a polite and informal conversation about things which aren&apos;t really important or meaningful when meeting people socially - like at a party, for example.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And in this programme you&apos;ll learn some vocabulary about communication. But first, a question: Rob, when do babies usually start talking? Is it when they are...</p>
<p>a) 9 months</p>
<p>b) 16 months or</p>
<p>c) 18 months&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, I know they start making noises at quite an early age. And I guess if that&apos;s talking, let me say (a) 9 months.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>OK. Well, we&apos;ll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Small talk is a social skill. Some people feel <strong>awkward</strong> - it means they feel uncomfortable, embarrassed - when they go to a party and don&apos;t know many people there.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Liz Brewer, the author of &apos;The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and&#xA0;<strong>Etiquette</strong>&apos;, knows a lot about what to do on these occasions. Etiquette is the set of rules which indicate what behaviour in a society is acceptable and what is not.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, the author knows a lot about etiquette. Let&apos;s listen to her advice. What expression does she use to describe the act of attempting to start a conversation with someone?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of &apos;The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and Etiquette&apos;<br></strong><em>You walk into a room, there&apos;s a sea of faces, well... (the) first thing we do is... it&apos;s the weather. We do it because we are in fact <strong>breaking the ice</strong>. That is a code. That means &apos;I want to talk to you&apos;. It&apos;s an easy subject, it&apos;s not too penetrating. We&apos;re very <strong>private </strong>people, we don&apos;t like to give too much information. So we are on safe ground. We start off with the weather. If that goes well, we then take it one step further.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Liz Brewer talks about breaking the ice. It means approaching someone you don&apos;t know and starting a friendly conversation with them.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And when you break the ice, talking about things which are not specific is the best way. You don&apos;t start a chat asking straight away where people live or what they do for a living.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And, as the author said, we are very private people. Private describes someone who doesn&apos;t like to give away their personal information, opinions or share their feelings. So we need more time to open up to people we&apos;ve just met.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Good. So now you know what to do at a party when you don&apos;t know the other guests.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>But, Neil. There is one particular situation I&apos;m not sure how to deal with. This is when I forget the name of the person I&apos;ve been making small talk with.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Yes, I know what that&apos;s like. You might not feel comfortable about allowing the person to realise you didn&apos;t really catch their name. It might sound <strong>rude</strong>.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Yes, that&apos;s right. I don&apos;t want to sound rude - which means ill-mannered or unpleasant. The person I&apos;ve just managed to approach might think I don&apos;t care.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Let&apos;s see what tip author on etiquette Liz Brewer has for us. Which words does she use instead of &quot;I have forgotten&quot;?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning &amp; Etiquette&quot;<br></strong><em>You can say &quot;Oh, just your name... it has just <strong>slipped my mind</strong> for the moment&quot;. And they say &quot;Paul&quot;, (you say) &quot;Oh no, no, no, I know you are Paul, it was the surname&quot;. Or they give you the surname and then you add the other. As I say, small talk is a code towards getting information and going further. Once you feel comfortable, then you can have these wonderful in-depth conversations. Those are the kinds of things you want to probably do later.</em><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Liz Brewer says &quot;your name has just slipped my mind&quot;, it&apos;s a gentler way of saying that they&apos;ve just forgotten the person&apos;s name. And pretending that you knew the person&apos;s name but you want the other name is a clever trick.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, it might sound like you forgot the name, but not completely. And this author shows that you have to interact with people in a charming way.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes... well, my co-presenter... your name has just slipped my mind for the moment...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Come on, Rob. You know! You know it&apos;s Neil.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it is Neil. I&apos;m just practising my social skills there.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m afraid you have to practise some other time because... well, I don&apos;t want to sound rude but we are running out of time. Let me give you the correct answer to the quiz question now.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. You asked me &quot;When do babies usually start talking?&quot; and you gave me three options.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, and the options were 9 months, 16 months or 18 months.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And I went for the first one, 9 months. Was I right?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>You were wrong. The correct answer was (c) 18 months. Now, according to the website webmd.com, there are some milestones in speech development. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say &quot;ba-ba&quot; or &quot;da-da&quot;. And then, after that, at 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words. At the age of 18 months babies say up to 10 simple words.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Ah, interesting stuff. And we are still learning words now, aren&apos;t we?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We are. Well, enough of this small talk. Let&apos;s remember some of the words we used today, Rob.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>They were:</p>
<p>small talk</p>
<p>awkward</p>
<p>etiquette</p>
<p>breaking the ice</p>
<p>private</p>
<p>rude</p>
<p>slipped my mind&#xA0;</p>
