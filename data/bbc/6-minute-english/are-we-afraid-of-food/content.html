<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alice<br></strong>&#x2026; and I&apos;m Alice. Neil, what are you eating?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Peanuts.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hmm. Did you know that one of the producers, here, has an allergy to peanuts?&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>No, I didn&apos;t &#x2013; but they&apos;re not in the studio with us, so it doesn&apos;t matter, does it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>It only takes a tiny piece of peanut to cause a big allergic reaction in some people. An <strong>allergy</strong> by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating, touching or breathing in a particular substance. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And food allergies are the subject of today&apos;s show. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Alright, put your peanuts down, Neil and answer today&apos;s quiz question. What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) penicillin?<br></span><span>b) adrenalin?<br></span><span>Or c) aspirin?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, well, I&apos;m going to go for a) penicillin.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, we&apos;ll find out if that&apos;s the right answer later on. Now let&apos;s listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing. She is a dietician here in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br>Dr Marianne Williams, gastroenterology dietician, UK<br></strong></span><span>For roughly the first month of life the immune system is switched off in essence and everything they [babies] get exposed to in that first month in life &#x2013; dogs, cats, aunts, uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt &#x2013; everything &#x2013; that is where they build up all the bacteria that are then going to colonise their gut in the future. Now, if you&apos;re born into a very sterile environment, as is increasingly the case in the western world, everything&apos;s kept terribly clean, and one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria at that very very early stage in that first month of life.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Dr Marianne Williams. The <strong>immune system</strong> is our body&apos;s defence against infection. And it&apos;s <strong>switched off</strong> &#x2013; or not working &#x2013; for the first month of a baby&apos;s life.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And through exposure to lots of things in our environment &#x2013; that&apos;s family, pets, dirt and so on &#x2013; young babies meet different bacteria for the first time which <strong>colonise</strong> &#x2013; or live and grow in &#x2013; their guts.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, but in a sterile environment babies don&apos;t <strong>get</strong> <strong>exposed to </strong>&#x2013; or don&apos;t meet &#x2013; a wide enough variety of bacteria.<strong> Sterile</strong> means completely clean and free of bacteria. And there&apos;s a theory that being too clean and bacteria-free &#x2013; now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation &#x2013; has lead to an increase in allergies.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So dirty play for babies is good &#x2013; mud, pets, picking stuff up off the floor and eating it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Used to? I still do. I enjoy food from the floor! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, what can I say? We&apos;re both lucky to be allergy-free. I have a friend who has an allergy to <strong>gluten</strong> &#x2013; a protein found in wheat and some other grains &#x2013; and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn&apos;t get ill.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>The supermarkets are quite helpful, though, aren&apos;t they, with products &apos;free from this&apos; and &apos;free from that&apos;? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>This is helpful, yes. But the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers who don&apos;t have a <strong>proven</strong> &#x2013; or tested &#x2013; allergy. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Why would you buy free-from foods if you don&apos;t have a food allergy? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, people have started to believe that certain foods &#x2013; like gluten or dairy &#x2013; are bad for us, though there isn&apos;t any medical evidence to support this. Let&apos;s hear about how <strong>rickets</strong> &#x2013; a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the diet &#x2013; is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mike Williams,</strong> <strong>BBC reporter<br></strong>R</span><span>ickets is common in the developing world but this is London in the 21st </span><span>century. These children aren&apos;t malnourished because they&apos;re too poor to eat well &#x2013; it&apos;s the opposite. Their often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with ingredients taken out. It&apos;s as if some of us have become unnecessarily frightened of our food.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Rickets usually affects <strong>malnourished </strong>childrenfrom poor countries&#x2013; children who don&apos;t have enough to eat &#x2013; and it makes their bones weak. But here in London some parents are buying their children expensive free-from foods &#x2013; for example to avoid dairy &#x2013; and are sometimes making them very ill.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>It sounds crazy, doesn&apos;t it? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yeah&#x2026; it&apos;s <strong>nuts</strong>! Get it? Nuts.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. Nuts - that means crazy. Now I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>OK, then. So earlier in the show I asked: What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it&#x2026; a) penicillin?&#xA0; b) adrenalin?&#xA0; Or c) aspirin?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I said a) penicillin.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, Neil! The correct answer is b) adrenalin. An injection of adrenalin can be used to treat <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> &#x2013; or severe allergic reactions &#x2013; to insect stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens. Antibiotics such as penicillin treat bacterial infections and aspirin is a painkiller you might take for a headache.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong></span><span>OK, can you tell us the words we heard today again please, Alice?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Sure. They are:<br></span><span>allergy<br></span><span>immune system<br></span><span>switched off<br></span><span>colonise<br></span><span>get exposed to<br></span><span>sterile<br></span><span>gluten<br></span><span>proven<br></span><span>rickets<br></span><span>malnourished<br></span><span>nuts<br></span><span>anaphylaxis</span></p>
