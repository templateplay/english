<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Neil. Have you ever written any poetry, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>No. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes. I&apos;ve got a sheaf of poems from my youth.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>A <strong>sheaf</strong> of something means a bundle of things, particularly paper. What about now? Are you still writing?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, my creative juices have dried up.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>What a shame! I would have liked to hear some of your poems! <strong>Creative juices</strong> means a flow of ideas and the subject of today&apos;s show is creativity and <strong>writer&apos;s block</strong> &#x2013; which means not being able to write because of a psychological problem.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So not like tennis elbow or golfer&apos;s knee, then.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>No, Neil, because a psychological problem refers to the mind not the body. And whilst some people view writer&apos;s block as nonsense others believe it is a serious psychological condition that can get better with treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I have a question for you, Alice. How does author of the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown, deal with writer&apos;s block? Does he&#x2026;<br>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>I think it&apos;s c) run a half-marathon listening to Wagner. Exercise and music might get your creative juices flowing again.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out whether you got the right answer later on in the show. <span>But first, Alice, can you tell us where the term writer&apos;s block comes from?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, the term was <strong>coined</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or invented &#x2013; in 1950 by a Viennese psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler. Let&apos;s</span> listen to <span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University talking about the psychoanalytic theory of writer&apos;s block.</span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University<br></span></strong><span>Before writers were blocked the other metaphors that were used were things like &apos;drying up&apos; &#x2026; or &apos;being frozen&apos; or &apos;stuck in a rut&apos; and so forth. And the difference between being blocked and drying up is that in the case of blockage the problem is externalised and objectified &#x2013; it&apos;s not yourself that&apos;s the problem &#x2013; it&apos;s something that&apos;s outside you like an obstacle or an impediment &#x2013; something that you could really cut away, and as a consequence a cure like a growth or a foreign body.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So writer&apos;s block is a metaphor for an obstacle &#x2013; something external rather than internal inside of you &#x2013; that&apos;s preventing you from working. Doesn&apos;t that sound like an excuse for not doing anything, Alice? &apos;It&apos;s not my fault &#x2013; this impediment thing is getting in the way&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. Well, <strong>impediment</strong> is another word for obstacle. But how do you cut away a foreign body that isn&apos;t actually there?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I suppose psychoanalysts have an answer for that. But seriously, I think writers probably do have a hard time. You can sit down at your desk every morning at 9 o&apos;clock to write but that doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re going to think of things to say. Though we&apos;re never stuck for words, are we?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Not usually, Neil, no. But did you know that the Ancient Greeks had <strong>Muses</strong> &#x2013; or goddesses of creativity &#x2013; to help them?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>So&#x2026; Beyonc&#xE9; isn&apos;t a real muse? I&apos;ve heard people say, you know, &apos;Beyonc&#xE9; is my muse; she&apos;s such a great singer, songwriter, dancer, role model!&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><span>Well, these days, &apos;muse&apos; can refer to anyone who inspires an artist, writer, or musician</span>. But in Ancient Greece, there<span> were nine Muses &#x2013; and depending on what type of creative thing you did &#x2013; philosophy, poetry, science and so on &#x2013; you <strong>invoked</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or called upon &#x2013; that particular Muse to inspire you.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I call upon you, oh Alice, to enlighten us with more information about the Greek Muses.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Alright then. So let&apos;s listen to Angie Hobbs instead. She&apos;s Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield here in the UK &#x2013; and here she is now, talking about what the Greek Muses symbolized.</span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield<br></span></strong><span>We&apos;ve seen that the Muses were connected to running water, to springs, to fountains, fluidity. So if you&apos;re musing, you are letting your mind wander, you&apos;re opening yourself up to new influences and new ideas, and not thinking in too structured a way. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Musing, letting your mind wander, thinking in a fluid, unstructured way &#x2013; that all sounds very pleasant &#x2013; maybe I should have another go at writing. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, according to research, some people are better at mind wandering and opening themselves up to new ideas than others. Their minds work differently &#x2013; they have more dopamine in the thalamus region of the brain. </span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><span>The <strong>thalamus</strong></span><span> controls consciousness, sleep and the senses and </span><strong>dopamine</strong> is the feel-good chemical in the brain<span>. Is that right?</span></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and having more dopamine in the thalamus enables some people to see the world in a different way &#x2013; and they express this creatively &#x2013; through science, music, the arts. Now, before you start musing on how much dopamine you have in your brain, Neil, perhaps you can tell us the answer to today&apos;s quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I asked: How does author of the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, Dan Brown, deal with writer&apos;s block? Does he&#x2026;<br>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And I said c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And you were wrong, Alice! The answer is a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. I expect all that increased blood flow to the brain is helpful in clearing writer&apos;s block.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. Good plan. OK, here are the words we learned today.<br>creative juices<br>writer&apos;s block<br>coined<br>impediment<br>Muses<br>invoked<br>thalamus<br>dopamine<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, Alice, shall I compare thee to a summer&apos;s day? Thou art more lovely&#x2026;<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>That&apos;s not your poem, Neil &#x2013; It&apos;s Shakespeare&apos;s! Well, and that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I&apos;m off to lie on the sofa and evoke my muse.
