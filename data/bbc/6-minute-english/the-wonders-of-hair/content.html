<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Welcome to 6 Minute English, where today we introduce a hair-raising topic and six items of vocabulary.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I&#x2019;m Tim&#x2026; So what&#x2019;s hair-raising about today&#x2019;s topic, Neil? <strong>Hair-raising</strong></span><span> means scary but also exciting!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We&#x2019;re talking about hair &#x2013; which may be exciting for some, but definitely won&#x2019;t be scary.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Hair-raising is a real thing, though, isn&#x2019;t it? Our hairs do rise!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes &#x2013; Tim, they do. We get goose bumps when we&#x2019;re cold, scared, or excited.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>But other mammals do it better than us &#x2013; Cats fluff up when they see other cats they don&#x2019;t like.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That&#x2019;s true &#x2013; We can&#x2019;t fluff up because we don&#x2019;t have enough body hair.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I suppose we used to be as hairy as gorillas &#x2013; if you go back a million years or so.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Do you know why we lost so much hair, Tim?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Isn&#x2019;t it because it allowed us to sweat more easily? This meant we didn&#x2019;t get so hot and tired &#x2013; we could run faster and for longer &#x2013; and catch more animals to eat!<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That sounds like a good theory. But do you have a theory on how many hair follicles the human body has today?&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>What&#x2019;s a hair follicle?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>A <strong>hair</strong></span><span> </span><strong><span>follicle</span></strong><span> is the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin. Now answer the question, Tim. How many hair follicles does the human body have today? Is it &#x2026;<br></span><span>a) 500,000,<br></span><span>b) 5 million or<br></span><span>c) 50 million?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>50 million sounds about right.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Did you know that men have more than women, Tim?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>No, I didn&#x2019;t &#x2013; but it makes sense since men are usually hairier than women.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>On their faces &#x2013; but not necessarily on their heads!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Are you referring to the fact that men of a certain age can be follically challenged?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>If you&#x2019;re follically challenged it means you&#x2019;re losing your hair! Having little or no hair is called <strong>baldness</strong></span><span>. And if you&#x2019;ve reached </span><strong><span>a certain age</span></strong><span> it means you aren&#x2019;t young any more!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Why is our hair so important to us, Neil? When we aren&#x2019;t worrying about going bald, we&#x2019;re busy shaving, waxing, plucking, and trimming the stuff. When I say &#x2018;we&#x2019; of course I&#x2019;m referring to people in general. Not myself&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, a good head of hair indicates health and youth. And hair on your face &#x2013; <strong>facial</strong></span><span> hair &#x2013; shows when boys have reached manhood.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>On the other hand, going grey or losing your hair shows you&#x2019;re getting older.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hair today, gone tomorrow?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Bad joke, Neil!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Sorry! It&#x2019;s true that hair on your head shows signs of aging &#x2013; but this isn&#x2019;t true of all human hair. Let&#x2019;s listen to Ralf Paus, a leading hair loss researcher, talking about this.<br><br></span><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher<br></span></strong><span>The eyebrows get stronger usually in aging men, the hairs in your nose and in your ears get stronger &#x2013; and what a miracle of nature that an organ &#x2013; when the entire body is aging actually grows stronger. So we may even be able to learn from hair follicles how not to age.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Hmm. I&#x2019;m not sure I would swap a good head of hair for thick eyebrows and nose hair. How about you, Neil?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I agree! But let&#x2019;s hear more from Ralf Paus about why some hair gets stronger as you get older.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher<br></span></strong><span>The hair follicle apparently knows some tricks that the other organs don&#x2019;t know. So it&#x2019;s continuously regenerating itself. It goes through a so-called hair cycle and part of that we know pretty well &#x2013; and that is, these stem cells that it uses to regenerate cells.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>So a hair follicle can <strong>regenerate</strong></span><span> cells &#x2013; or grow new cells to replace old or damaged ones. But if that&#x2019;s only true for eyebrows, nose and ear hair, I am not that impressed! I want hairs on my head to be able to regenerate!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>The important thing here is that these cells in the hair follicle may help scientists discover a way to stop other organs of the body aging&#x2026; OK, I&#x2019;m now going to reveal how many hair follicles on average we have on our bodies. The answer is&#x2026; 5 million.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Oh. So not 50 million then.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Don&#x2019;t worry, Tim! It was a tricky question! Now let&#x2019;s go over the words we learned today.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x2018;Hair-raising&#x2019; means scary often in an exciting way. For example, &#x201C;That ride on the rollercoaster was a hair-raising experience!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Next is &#x2018;hair follicle&#x2019; &#x2013; the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;Scientists believe that stress can affect hair follicles.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>A number of things can affect hair follicles actually &#x2013; age, disease, diet&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>OK &#x2013; but we haven&#x2019;t got all day, Neil. So let&#x2019;s move on to the next item. &#x2018;Baldness&#x2019; &#x2013; which means having little or no hair on your head.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;My grandfather is bald and he always wears a hat to cover his baldness.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Nice example. Is your grandpa actually bald, Neil?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>No &#x2013; he has a fine head of hair. Now, if you are a certain age, it means you are no longer young. For example&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;All the people at the party were of a certain age&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>How many of them had facial hair, Tim? That&#x2019;s our next word, and &#x2018;facial&#x2019; means to do with the face.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;None of the people at the party had facial hair.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s your answer!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That&#x2019;s unusual, Tim. Lots of men have beards these days. OK &#x2013; our final word for today is &#x2018;regenerate&#x2019; which means to grow again. You can talk about regenerating a range of things, for example&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;The council has plans to regenerate this part of the city.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;Regeneration of parts of the city is in progress.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x2018;regeneration&#x2019; is the noun.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, it&#x2019;s time to go now. But if today&#x2019;s show gave you goosebumps please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Bye-bye!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Goodbye!</span></p></div>
