<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I&apos;m Neil. So Alice, can you think of an example of how the English we speak is changing?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, I can &#x2013; teenagers saying &apos;like&apos; all the time&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Oh, that&apos;s, like, really like annoying, like? </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, the subject of today&apos;s show is how and why the English language is changing. And teenagers definitely have their own code &#x2013; including text speak when they&apos;re on the internet or using their phones. Fomo, bae, plos &#x2013; do you have any idea what those terms mean, Neil? </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&apos;ve got no idea what you&apos;re talking about, Alice. They&apos;re pretty <strong>baffling</strong></span><span> &#x2013; and that means &apos;hard to understand&apos;. But that&apos;s the idea, isn&apos;t it? We oldies aren&apos;t supposed to understand!</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, exactly! Apparently, &apos;plos&apos; means &apos;parents looking over shoulder&apos; &#x2013; which proves your point! Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms &#x2013; and these change quickly. In a year, or even six months time, words that were once popular, have disappeared completely.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice &#x2013; so I hope you&apos;re feeling up to the challenge, Alice. Can you tell me, what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it...<br></span><span>a) nouns?<br></span><span>b) pronouns?<br></span><span>Or c) adjectives?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>I think it&apos;s a) nouns. The way we name things probably doesn&apos;t change that quickly. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We shall find out if you are right or wrong later on in the show. But let&apos;s think about English grammar for a minute, and what changes are occurring here. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>I noticed you said &apos;shall&apos; there, Neil. And to my ear, that sounds pretty old fashioned.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And you&apos;re very right, Alice. The modal verb &apos;shall&apos; is <strong>on the way out</strong></span><span> &#x2013; meaning it&apos;s disappearing. Why do you think that is?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, perhaps it&apos;s because &apos;will&apos; sounds more natural these days. Let&apos;s listen to linguist Bas Aarts, talking to writer and presenter, Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span>, </span><span>for his explanation.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London<br></span></strong><span>MR: Why would we lose &apos;shall&apos;? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative. We say, you know, &apos;Shall we go swimming&apos;?<br></span><span>BA: Well, because it&apos;s in competition with &apos;will&apos;. If you have two words that more or less express the same meaning, one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language. And in this case, it&apos;s &apos;shall&apos;.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Bas Aarts there. And <strong>interrogative</strong></span><span> means &apos;a question&apos;. So it&apos;s not just in nature that we get survival of the fittest &#x2013; you know, the struggle for life &#x2013; it happens in language too. Similar words are competing with each other, and some lose while others </span><strong><span>win out</span></strong><span> &#x2013; or succeed after a fight. Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes &#x2013; &apos;must&apos; is declining rapidly.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Why&apos;s that?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>&apos;Must&apos; sounds authoritarian, and people are choosing to express <strong>obligation</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or having a duty to do something &#x2013; in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, <strong>authoritarian</strong></span><span> means &apos;demanding that people obey you&apos;. For example: Alice, you must move on to the next point, now!</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Oh, you scared me a bit there, Neil!</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. I can see why people are <strong>shying away from</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or avoiding &#x2013; &apos;must&apos;. It sounds nicer to soften obligation by saying things like, &apos;You </span><em><span>might</span></em><span> want to move on to the next point now, Alice.&apos;</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>OK, then, I shall. Let&apos;s talk about tenses. <strong>Progressive</strong></span><span> tenses &#x2013; formed from the verb </span><em><span>be</span></em><span> and the suffix &#x2013;</span><em><span>ing</span></em><span> &#x2013; are usually used for ongoing situations, for example, &apos;I&apos;m doing the show with Neil at the moment&apos;. But its use has been increasing rapidly. Let&apos;s listen to Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts again talking about this.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London <br></span></strong><span>BA: It started increasing dramatically in the 19th </span><span>century and has continued to rise in the present day.<br></span><span>MR: I think that&apos;s a cue for me to say, &apos;I&apos;m loving it&apos;, is that right?<br></span><span>BA: Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in, I mean, I sometimes call it the Big Mac progressive because of course McDonald&apos;s use that.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"> </span><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">In this segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span data-mce-mark="1">, Michael Rosen quotes the progressive form &apos;I&apos;m loving it&apos; &#x2013; a slogan used by an American fast-food chain in its advertising campaign.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>The verb &apos;love&apos; is a <strong>stative</strong></span><span> verb. It expresses a state of being &#x2013; as opposed to doing &#x2013; and is traditionally used in the simple form, for example, &apos;I love it&apos;. </span><span>But these days, people are using stative verbs in the progressive more and more.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&apos;m hearing what you&apos;re saying, Alice! Now, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked you: What kinds of words are slow to change? Is it&#x2026; a) nouns, b) pronouns or c) adjectives?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>I said a) nouns.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, Alice! According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like &apos;I&apos; and &apos;you&apos; and &apos;we&apos; evolve slowly &#x2013; a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds. Similarly, number words evolve very slowly &#x2013; our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago. Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly &#x2013; and in five hundred years or so we&apos;ll probably be using different words to the ones we use now.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, I got that completely wrong then! Who knew that one, two, three would have such staying power?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I suppose numbers are pretty fundamental to our day-to-day lives &#x2013; sort of part of who we are. </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>OK, let&apos;s hear the - hopefully - more permanent words we learned today.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>There were:<br></span><span>baffling<br></span><span>on the way out<br></span><span>interrogative<br></span><span>win out<br></span><span>obligation<br></span><span>authoritarian<br></span><span>shying away from<br></span><span>progressive<br></span><span>stative<br><br></span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. To recap, we&apos;re enjoying the progressive tense.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And we&apos;re loving &apos;will&apos; and &apos;should&apos;, but avoiding &apos;shall&apos; and &apos;must&apos;. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!<br><br></span><strong><span>Both<br> </span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p></div>
