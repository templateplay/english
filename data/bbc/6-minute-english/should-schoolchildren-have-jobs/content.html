<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil and joining me today is Dan who is a producer at BBC Learning English &#x2013; that&apos;s his job.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hi everyone&#x2026; Yes that is my job, obviously &#x2013; why are we discussing that now, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well you haven&apos;t always been a producer at BBC Learning English, have you?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>No&#x2026; I used to be a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> And before that? Way back &#x2013; your first ever job?<br> <br> <strong>Dan</strong><br> Ah, I had a <strong>paper round</strong> when I was 14. A paper round is a job &#x2013; the job of delivering newspapers to people&apos;s homes. It&apos;s often done by teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>14 seems very young to be at work. And that&apos;s the topic of this 6 Minute English: Should schoolchildren have jobs? It seems fewer and fewer are these days, according to the statistics. We&apos;ll give you 6 job-related words and expressions &#x2013; and, of course, our quiz question. You Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>You bet!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK? &#xA0;</p>
<p>a) 12</p>
<p>b) 13</p>
<p>c) 14</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m going to say 14 just because that&apos;s how old I was and it seems a long time ago!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We&apos;ll find out at the end of the programme.&#xA0; Let&apos;s start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their <strong>Saturday jobs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work that teenagers do for extra money. As the name suggests, these jobs often take place on Saturdays &#x2013; but not always.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s right -&#xA0; &apos;Saturday job&apos; is general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers. The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week, in fact! Let&apos;s hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Insert Vox<br></strong>We have to face all the stuff on the shelves and make it look organised and show customers where products are if they need to know.</p>
<p>On the average week I work nine hours, so two hours for two school nights and then I work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. And then in the school holidays I can work more.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>The first kid said the work involves making the shelves look organised. Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes, I spent many a weekend and evening stacking shelves! The second teenager&apos;s Saturday job takes place Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. As we said &#x2013; A Saturday job&apos;s not just for Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A Saturday job is seen almost as a <strong>rite of passage</strong> in the UK. A rite of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies that form an important stage in a person&apos;s life.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s right &#x2013; like graduating from school, or having children. But according to the latest statistics in the UK, that is all changing. Listen to this BBC report.</p>
<p><strong>Insert BBC reporter<br></strong>In order to work, they need a permit from the local authority and our data shows the number being issued has fallen from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016. Employers frequently <strong>bemoan</strong> the lack of work experience young people have. But teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies instead.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>So, it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs. But there&apos;s a conflict here.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, on the one hand, employers bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. Bemoan, meaning complain about. It&apos;s a rather formal word.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>But on the other hand, teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies. Some people think working could be <strong>detrimental</strong> to a schoolchild&apos;s academic progress.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Detrimental - which means causing harm. It&apos;s a tricky one, isn&apos;t it? I think my Saturdays spend stacking shelves and serving fish &apos;n&apos; chips taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money. I don&apos;t think it was detrimental to my education.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English! As for me, my paper round taught me the value of hard work. It didn&apos;t <strong>hinder</strong> me. Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> Well let&apos;s not talk too much in case we hinder our students&#x2026; On to the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?&#xA0;</p>
<p>a) 12</p>
<p>b) 13</p>
<p>c) 14</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I said c) 14.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m afraid you are wrong. You are allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK. Exceptions to this rule include TV, theatre and modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Oh well &#x2013; I guess I should have spent more time at school.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Did you have a paper round as a kid, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No I didn&apos;t, but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers - in return for a pound. Big money back in the 80s!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Did you supplement your earnings with a <strong>Saturday job</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I did. I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fish &apos;n&apos; chip shop &#x2013; but it wasn&apos;t always on a Saturday. Free chips! Dan is that a wedding ring on your finger?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes it is. Marriage is a rite of passage in many cultures. It is an important stage in a person&apos;s life &#x2013; talking of which, are those your kids on your screensaver?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yep &#x2013; having children is another example of a rite of passage. See how tired I look!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Do not bemoan your lack of sleep! Bemoan&apos;s a quite formal way of saying &apos;complain about&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I think it&apos;s OK to bemoan my lack of sleep &#x2013; it can have a detrimental effect on my health.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Detrimental &#x2013; meaning harmful. As long as your tiredness doesn&apos;t hinder your work on 6 Minute English</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I&apos;d never let anything hinder &#x2013; meaning stop from making progress &#x2013; 6 Minute English.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I admire your dedication! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>See ya!</p></div>
