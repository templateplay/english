<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six items of incredibly useful vocabulary. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil. In this programme we&#x2019;ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch &#x2013; and what our lunch choices say about us<em>. </em>So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Ah Neil, are you asking me to join you? I&#x2019;d love to, thanks. There&#x2019;s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right&#xA0;next to&#xA0;the office if you just&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, actually &#x2013; I was just asking to&#x2026; open up today&#x2019;s topic. Sorry. You see, I&#x2019;ve brought a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Oh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you&#x2019;re not the only one &#x2013; a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch &#x2013; every day! And yes, it&#x2019;s mostly sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I had a curry yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, it&#x2019;s almost lunchtime so we&#x2019;d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it:</p>
<p>a) An hour and a half</p>
<p>b) 45 minutes</p>
<p>c) 25 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, we&#x2019;ll find out if you&#x2019;re right&#x2026; just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit <strong>peckish</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Peckish</strong> is a great word isn&#x2019;t it &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn&#x2019;t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Bee Wilson, Author<br></strong>They were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of <strong>makeshift</strong> lunch when you couldn&#x2019;t get anything better.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>So &#x2013; sandwiches had humble origins as <strong>makeshift</strong> meals. <strong>Makeshift</strong> describes something temporary and low quality &#x2013; a solution you create when you can&#x2019;t do anything better.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I can&#x2019;t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>There&#x2019;s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich &#x2013; like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there&#x2019;s no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>If you worked as hard as I did, Dan &#x2013; you&#x2019;d only have time for a sandwich!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Which is just what Bee Wilson was saying &#x2013; we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let&#x2019;s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And let&#x2019;s teach one more word first &#x2013; <strong>utilitarian</strong>. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Julian Baggini, Philosopher<br></strong>What lunch says about us is that we&#x2019;re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, <strong>utilitarian</strong> attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our <strong>embrace</strong> of this great food culture and everything, we haven&#x2019;t managed to make that an everyday thing &#x2013; it remains something for the special occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So &#x2013; he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient &#x2013; where we have a functional, <strong>utilitarian</strong> attitude to life.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Exactly, we&#x2019;re aware of a great food culture, we <strong>embrace </strong>this culture &#x2013; but only for special occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes &#x2013; let&#x2019;s look at that word <strong>embrace</strong>. It normally means this&#x2026; let me just&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Oh Neil, I didn&#x2019;t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, <strong>embraced</strong> me.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Just as we can <strong>embrace</strong> physical things and people &#x2013; we can also <strong>embrace</strong> ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Here&#x2019;s an idea I <strong>embrace</strong>, Neil. We should all <strong>embrace</strong> new foods. <strong>Broaden our horizons</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>To <strong>broaden our horizons</strong> means &apos;to open our minds and experience new things&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Let me <strong>broaden your horizons</strong> right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better <strong>team spirit</strong> if colleagues eat together.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of <strong>team spirit</strong> &#x2013; that is &#x2013; getting on well with team members &#x2013; having a feeling of belonging.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Finally. Vietnamese?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today&#x2019;s question. How long do Brits take for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>25 minutes? It&#x2019;s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let&#x2019;s run over the vocab one more time.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>First up we had <strong>peckish</strong>. It means &apos;hungry &#x2013; just a little hungry&apos;. I&#x2019;m feeling rather <strong>peckish</strong> at the moment, you?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I think I&#x2019;ve gone beyond <strong>peckish</strong>, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We had <strong>makeshift</strong> &#x2013; which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team&#x2019;s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a <strong>makeshift</strong> goalie.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Or, another example &#x2013; when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a <strong>makeshift</strong> drum.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&#x2019;m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word <strong>utilitarian</strong>? In the context we used it, it means &apos;simple and functional, rather than beautiful&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Do you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as <strong>utilitarian</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I prefer classic and timeless. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Oh, are you going to hug me again? To <strong>embrace</strong> me?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Not this time, let&#x2019;s stick with the metaphorical meaning &#x2013; &apos;to accept a new belief or idea&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>For example, I wasn&#x2019;t sure about the new website design, but now I fully <strong>embrace </strong>it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Very nice. And I <strong>embrace</strong> your suggestion that colleagues should eat together.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>It looks like you&#x2019;ve <strong>broadened your horizons</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really <strong>broadened my horizons </strong>and taught me about new ways of life. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, they say travel broadens the mind &#x2013; it certainly <strong>broadened my horizons </strong>too.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Even better &#x2013; why don&#x2019;t we go travelling together &#x2013; with the whole Learning English team?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yeah! That would be wonderful for <strong>team spirit</strong> &#x2013;the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It certainly would. And that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon, after our delicious lunch!</p>
