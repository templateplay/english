<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Sophie&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Neil. Oh, hang on&#x2026; I&apos;ve just got a new tweet here. Listen to this: &#x2018;Hi Neil, about what you said the other day I&#x2026;&apos; Oh, this is from a friend who doesn&apos;t realize that regular tweets are in the public domain &#x2013; and that anyone in the world could read them if they wanted to. I need to give her some lessons in cool &#x2013; she just doesn&apos;t get it!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, Mr Cool, I don&apos;t <strong>get</strong> Twitter either &#x2013; which means I don&apos;t understand why people like it. Why do you want to put tweets out there for everyone to read?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>You&apos;d love it if you tried it, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I&apos;m not so sure, Neil. Anyway, the subject of today&apos;s show is online identity. There are lots of social media platforms out there &#x2013; Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram &#x2013; and they&apos;re all different, and the question is, do we use different identities when we are using different digital spaces? And what&apos;s all this tweeting, posting, and hashtagging doing to our language and our psyche?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>psyche</strong> means mind. Well, it&apos;s messed with my mind. I&apos;m a total addict. I check my accounts as soon as I get up in the morning &#x2013; and sometimes in the night if I wake up. I couldn&apos;t get through the day without it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m the opposite &#x2013; I&apos;m totally unaddicted &#x2013; and therefore don&apos;t need to worry about my psyche. Now, before we explore this further, let&apos;s have today&apos;s quiz question.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, here&apos;s one for you, Sophie. Can you tell me how many social media accounts the average person has? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 3?<br>b) 5?<br>Or c) 8?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I&apos;ll say 3 &#x2013; though that sounds like 3 too many to me.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, we&apos;ll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. I&apos;ve got &#x2026; 3&#x2026; 5 no hang on. I&apos;ve got 6&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>While you add up all your accounts, Neil, let&apos;s listen to Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist. She&apos;s talking about the language we use to present ourselves online.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br></strong>Online we have this extraordinary opportunity to explore different aspects of ourselves through primarily text-based communication, by manipulating language and becoming wordsmiths ourselves. So for example, your Twitter handle will have a &#x2018;you&apos; that is probably different from a &#x2018;you&apos; that you share if, say, for example you have a Facebook account, or is different from a &#x2018;you&apos; that you would share if you&apos;re on a particular forum of something that you like &#x2013; some music that you like, or food that you like, or whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>So we are wordsmiths with handles. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A <strong>wordsmith</strong> is someone who is skilled at using words. And a <strong>handle</strong> means a name.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>What&apos;s your Twitter handle, then?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you&apos;ll need to get a Twitter account to find out. But I have other handles for other social media.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>So there are lots of &#x2018;yous&apos; out there, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. For example, I think I&apos;m cooler on Twitter than on Facebook. I talk more, you know, street. &#x2018;Check out my new creps &#x2013; they&apos;re bangin&apos;.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yo &#x2013; they&apos;re well sick.<strong> Street</strong>, by the way, refers to the language that goes with street &#x2013; or urban &#x2013; culture, where things like skate boarding and hip-hop are popular. And I think &#x2018;creps&apos; are trainers &#x2013; am I right, bruv?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, Sophie. I didn&apos;t know you could talk street!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I have identities that you know nothing about, Neil! But getting back to Twitter and how big an audience there is, doesn&apos;t that huge audience worry you, Neil? Aren&apos;t you scared of making a huge blooper online and becoming a laughing stock?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, <strong>blooper</strong> means an embarrassing mistake &#x2013; and being <strong>a laughing stock</strong> means looking very silly when you were trying to be serious. Well, Sophie, I&apos;m quite careful about how I manage my online identity. I take time to craft my words &#x2013; just like I craft them for this show!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Really? So no bloopers, on this show, then? I seem to remember one or two&#x2026; Well, let&apos;s move on now and listen now to Dr Aleks Krotoski again,talking about what motivates us to put our thoughts and ideas out there online.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br></strong>It&apos;s allowing us a platform for a potential audience that is massive, absolutely huge, so yeah, there is a lot of &#x2018;look at me, look at me&apos; online, but that&apos;s, I think, because we&apos;re trying to reach out to as much of the audience &#x2013; we&apos;re trying to get as much attention as we possibly can, in order to get that tribe. And, also, in order to basically reach out and tell people, &apos;Hey we&apos;re around&apos;. It&apos;s like having a telephone on all the time: &#x2018;Hey, chat to me. I&apos;m here. Anybody wanna hang out?&apos; It&apos;s a big social playground.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Aleks Krotoski says we&apos;re all show offs who want attention. Am I a show off, Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, you are, Neil. Though Aleks says it isn&apos;t just about showing off &#x2013; it&apos;s also about connecting with people in our <strong>tribe</strong> &#x2013; or social group. But that tribe can be enormous because people are reading posts globally &#x2013; not just in your own town or even your own country.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hastag scarythought! Now, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked: How many social media accounts does the average person have? Is it&#x2026; a) 3, b) 5 or c) 8?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I said b) 3.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And that is &#x2026; not the right answer, Sophie. The average person has 5 social media accounts and spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks every day, accounting for 28% of the total time spent on the internet. Now, here are the words we heard today:<br>get something<br>psyche<br>wordsmith<br>handle<br>street<br>blooper<br>laughing stock<br>tribe</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>And that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And remember you can tweet us @bbcle!</p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!</p>
