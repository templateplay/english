<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And I&apos;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now Rob, Can you complete this saying: &#x201C;Love and marriage go together like &#x2026;.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Love and marriage go together like&#x2026; a horse and carriage!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&#x2019;s right, and when was the last time you saw a horse and carriage?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well that would have been a while ago &#x2013; they are quite rare now. Not an everyday sight.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed. And according to recent statistics, marriage in the UK is getting rarer too. Not as rare as seeing a horse and carriage, but the numbers are falling. Before we look at this topic in a bit more detail, a little quiz for our listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, according to UK&#x2019;s Office for National Statistics, how many opposite-sex marriages were there in 2015? Was it:</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 239,000</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 309,000</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 339,000</p>
<p>Any idea Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I have no idea but I&apos;m going to have a guess and say a) 239,000.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll reveal the answer a little later in this programme. But whatever the correct number, the <strong>trend </strong>is downwards. Year on year there are fewer opposite sex couples getting married in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So why might this be? Are we falling out of love with marriage? Let&#x2019;s hear from a couple of people with different views. First, here&#x2019;s Tom from BBC Learning English - what doesn&#x2019;t he like about the idea or <strong>concept </strong>of getting married?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Banks<br></strong>I&apos;m not that enthusiastic about the idea of marriage, to tell you the truth. I think it&apos;s a bit of <strong>an archaic concept</strong> these days and I&apos;m a bit of <strong>a commitment phobe</strong> &#x2013; I don&apos;t like the idea of signing a piece of paper that says I have to be with someone for the rest of my life and can never escape from that person I suppose &#x2013; although I am in a very happy relationship at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So that was Tom there. Not a fan of marriage. But what were his objections Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, he described marriage as <strong>an archaic concept</strong>. When someone describes something as <strong>archaic </strong>they think it is very old fashioned, out of date &#x2013; belonging to a different time.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So that was one of his problems with marriage, but he also said that he was a <strong>commitment phobe</strong>. The suffix <strong>phobe</strong> means someone who is afraid of something. In some cases it can also be used as a standalone word, but it means the same. So a <strong>commitment phobe</strong> is someone who is afraid of, or doesn&#x2019;t like the idea of <strong>commitment</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And when talking about relationships, <strong>commitment</strong> means being with one person and giving up the idea of being free to do whatever you want and see whoever you want romantically.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So for <strong>commitment phobes</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong> means losing something.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But that&#x2019;s not true for everyone. Here&#x2019;s Dan, also from BBC Learning English. What&#x2019;s his view of marriage?</p>
<p><strong>Dan O&apos;Brien<br></strong>In general I think it&apos;s quite good. It has a very <strong>stabilising </strong>effect on society and it declares publicly to the world that you have found the right person for you and that you&apos;re in a&#xA0;committed relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So Dan is a fan. He thinks marriage has a <strong>stabilising</strong> effect on society. He sees marriage as being good for society as a whole - it makes society stronger, more stable.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And he also sees it as a way to say to everyone that you have a strong relationship, you are with the one person you love.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So for Dan, <strong>commitment</strong> and being in a committed relationship is a good thing. Now, back to our question at the top of the programme. I asked: how many opposite-sex couples got married in the UK in 2015?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I took a guess, didn&apos;t I, and I said a) 239,000. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>You are definitely right. The answer is 239,000 or 239,020 to be precise. That figure was 3.4% lower than 2014. So what do relationship experts think is the reason fewer people are getting married?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well there could be lots of reasons. In some countries the way society is changing means that there is less pressure to get married or stay married. As a result, there are more divorces. So perhaps children of divorced parents are less likely to get married themselves.</p>
<p>Right, well before we go, let&#x2019;s recap the vocabulary we highlighted today. The first word was <strong>trend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>A <strong>trend</strong> is the direction that something is changing over time. When it comes to marriage, the trend is for fewer marriages. And the trend for 6-Minute listeners is the opposite, going up, particularly when you are presenting, Neil</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, that&#x2019;s very nice of you, you&#x2019;re very kind. The next two words were an <strong>archaic concept</strong>. <strong>Archaic </strong>is an adjective for something dated or old-fashioned.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>A bit like your fashion sense!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Just when I was beginning to like you!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Sorry about that, you know I don&#x2019;t mean it. In the interview <strong>archaic</strong> was used to describe the <strong>concept</strong> of marriage, not your fashion sense. <strong>Concept </strong>is another word for an idea or belief. So an <strong>archaic concept</strong> is an old-fashioned idea.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Our next expression was <strong>commitment phobe</strong>. We use this phrase to talk about someone who is scared of the idea of a long-term relationship because they see it as giving up some freedoms. You&#x2019;re obviously a <em>compliment</em> <strong>phobe</strong>! You&#x2019;re afraid of saying nice things about someone so you always say something nasty as well!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And finally we had the adjective <strong>stabilising</strong>. Something that is stable is strong and something that makes something strong can be described as <strong>stabilising</strong>. Dan expressed his belief that marriage had a <strong>stabilising</strong> effect on society.</p>
