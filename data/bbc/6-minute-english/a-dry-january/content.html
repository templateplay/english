<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I&apos;m Catherine. In this programme we&apos;ll be discussing <strong>quitting</strong> drinking and staying dry. &#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Right, so when you say &#x2018;quitting&#x2019;, you mean &#x2018;giving up&#x2019; &#x2013; and when you say &#x2018;drinking&#x2019;, you&apos;re particularly referring to &#x2018;the activity of drinking alcohol&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>But, what about staying dry? It&apos;s nothing to do with the weather?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No that&apos;s true. The adjective &#x2018;dry&#x2019; here means &#x2018;no alcohol&#x2019;. And I, Rob, am currently having a dry January.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Ah yes, your New Year&apos;s <strong>resolution</strong> is to give up alcohol for one month. Any reason?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. I&apos;m doing it in order to improve my health and save some money. And a resolution, by the way, is a promise to yourself to do something or not to do something.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well they seem like good reasons. And for now, we must keep up our resolution to always start the programme with a question, so are you ready for it, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I am, crack on, Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>According to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed the most alcohol per person? Was it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Australia</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Finland</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The Czech Republic</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well they&apos;re sound quite likely, but I did visit Prague once and I had a lovely time, so I&apos;m going to say c) the Czech Republic.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well as always, we&apos;ll find out the answer later on. But let&apos;s continue our discussion about drinking &#x2013; or informally known as boozing &#x2013; and trying to give it up. We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us and that&apos;s why you Catherine, have decided to quit &#x2013; but only for a month.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes just a month but it&apos;s a start and I might continue into February. But I&apos;m seeing the benefits already. I&apos;ve managed <strong>to shed</strong> some weight &#x2013; most of which I actually put on over Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I can see. So <strong>to shed</strong> here simply means &apos;lose&apos;. And I bet your <strong>sobriety</strong> is helping you sleep better. Sobriety, by the way, means &#x2018;the state of not being drunk&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is actually. And I&apos;m not alone: A study of 857 British adults by Dr Richard de Visser from the University of Sussex found that after going for a month without alcohol, 62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep. So Rob, does that tempt you to become teetotal and stop drinking?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Not me Catherine. I need a drink to help me relax and be more sociable &#x2013; you know how shy I am!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes of course Rob! Well, maybe you should listen to Catherine Gray. She&apos;s the author of a book called The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober, which she wrote after she discovered the negative effects of going to too many work-related parties where she was just drinking too much. Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Woman&apos;s Hour programme&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br></strong>I had a lot of social anxiety and when I quit I had to deal with that. I think I used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>, a confidence crutch - it eased the way to go to big glittering parties and stuff like that and when I quit I had to learn real confidence in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So Catherine worked in the magazine business which involved going to lots of boozy parties. Drinking, she says, helped herdeal with a nervous and worried feeling that she had when she met new people - she called it social anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and she used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>. A crutch here is something you depend on for support &#x2013; and sometimes you rely on it too much.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes and eventually she decided to <strong>abstain</strong> from drinking &#x2013; in other words stop doing something that is enjoyable but bad for you &#x2013; and she feels much better for it. So come on Rob, haven&apos;t you got the willpower to just quit drinking for just 30 days?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well according to Catherine Gray, that wouldn&apos;t be long enough&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br> </strong>Experts say that it takes 66 days for a new habit to <strong>bed in</strong>, so I would always recommend trying it for 90 days. 30 days is the hard bit before you get to the rewards. Because after 66 days it starts getting a lot easier and you start feeling better in yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so it takes 66 days for doing a regular activity - a habit - to <strong>bed in</strong>. And &#x2018;bed in&#x2019; means to &#x2018;become normal and start working properly&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, earlier I asked you, according to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed the most alcohol per person? Was it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Australia</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Finland</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The Czech Republic</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I said the Czech Republic. Was I right?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>You were Catherine. Spot on, well done. Apparently, 14.1 litres of pure alcohol is consumed per person each year.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well like I said, they do make good beer in the Czech Republic &#x2013; but people, be careful, only drink it in moderation. Now Rob, shall we take a look at the vocabulary we&apos;ve mentioned today?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Indeed. The first word we had was <strong>resolution</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s a promise to yourself to do or not do something. &apos;Catherine&apos;s New Year&apos;s resolution was to give up drinking alcohol for a whole month.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and I&apos;m still doing it Rob &#x2013; the plan is <strong>to shed</strong> a few kilos and get fit. So for example, &apos;Rob shed lots of weight when he went on a cake-free diet!&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Really? I&apos;d never give up cake Catherine, but I could be tempted to give up booze as I know <strong>sobriety </strong>is good for my health &#x2013; that&apos;s the noun word to mean &#x2018;the state of not being drunk&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now our next word was <strong>abstain</strong>. That means &#x2018;not do something that is enjoyable but bad for you&#x2019;. &apos;Rob needs to abstain from eating cakes if he wants to wear his skinny jeans.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Are you dropping a hint there, Catherine?&#xA0; Now, our final word is actually two words &#x2013; <strong>bed in</strong>. It means &#x2018;to become normal and start working properly&#x2019;. &apos;It took a while for the new computer system to bed in but now it&apos;s working perfectly.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That&apos;s brilliant because now we can go online and find more BBC Learning English programmes at bbclearningenglish.com. That&apos;s all for today&apos;s 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye.</p></div>
