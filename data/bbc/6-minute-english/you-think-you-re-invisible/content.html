<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six items of useful vocabulary. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I&apos;m Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, Dan, have you ever wanted to become <strong>invisible</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>Invisible</strong> &#x2013; impossible to see. Of course! Who hasn&apos;t?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well how about this: most of us think we <em>are</em> in fact invisible, at least some of the time&#x2026; We&apos;ll be looking at the &apos;<strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>&apos; in this programme.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Fascinating. And in that phrase we heard our first three words. <strong>Invisibility</strong> &#x2013; the state of being <strong>invisible</strong>. A <strong>cloak</strong> is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the third word in that phrase &#x2013; an <strong>illusion</strong> &#x2013; is something that seems real but isn&apos;t.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>OK, question time. Which of these stories features an <strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong>? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) The Hobbit</p>
<p>b) Harry Potter</p>
<p>Or c) The Invisible Man</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I know they are all connected to invisibility, but I&apos;m gonna say&#x2026;a) The Hobbit.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Ok &#x2013; we&apos;ll reveal the answer later on. Now, let&apos;s hear more about this <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>. What&apos;s the theory, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right &#x2013; imagine you&apos;re sitting in a crowded train. People are busy looking at phones and books, but they&apos;re also looking at each other.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>They&apos;re &apos;people-watching&apos;, as we call it. Yes. Yes, I do that. I do it a lot, if I&apos;m honest!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So &#x2013; where does the <strong>invisibility </strong>part come in?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this. Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University. What did the Yale team find?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University</strong></p>
<p>So this study, they asked people that, first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody, and how much they thought those people were observing them. And there was always a <strong>mismatch</strong>. People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>So, people think they observe others more than others watch them. Everyone thinks they aren&apos;t observed very much - it&apos;s almost as if they&apos;re <strong>invisible</strong> to others &#x2013; or wearing an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and <em>think </em>they&apos;re being watched is what she called a <strong>mismatch</strong>. It&apos;s the difference between two things &#x2013; they&apos;re two things which don&apos;t &apos;match&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>In other words &#x2013; it&apos;s not true that people aren&apos;t watching us &#x2013; which is why the idea of having an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> is just an <strong>illusion</strong>. This next bit is interesting. Two people were asked to wait in a room. Then they were each asked to make two lists: one, what they noticed about the other person; and two, what <em>they thought</em> the other person noticed about them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So list one was always longer than list two. Not only that &#x2013; but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Let&apos;s hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday. What was the difference?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University<br></strong>When people are observing you they&apos;re doing it in a non-<strong>judgemental</strong>, fairly empathic way &#x2013; and not actually noticing the things that you&apos;re <strong>self-conscious</strong> about. So if for example you feel <strong>self-conscious</strong> about a spot on your nose, or something that you&apos;re wearing, that won&apos;t be what they&apos;re noticing. It&apos;s a much less <strong>judgemental</strong> form of observation.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right, so even if we&apos;re feeling <strong>self-conscious</strong> about something &#x2013; that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves &#x2013; maybe our appearance or our clothes &#x2013; we needn&apos;t be.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, you don&apos;t need to feel <strong>self-conscious</strong>. People aren&apos;t being <strong>judgemental</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And being <strong>judgemental</strong> means being critical.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>That&apos;s good news. So even though all I&apos;m thinking about is how badly I need a haircut, the other person is probably noticing something completely different. Back to the question about the <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>. Which story is it in?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I said The Hobbit.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And it was in fact &#x2013; Harry Potter. Not only does the garment make you impossible to see, it also protects you against magic spells.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Wow &#x2013; I need one of those!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>In The Hobbit, it&apos;s a ring that makes you <strong>invisible</strong>, and in The <strong>Invisible</strong> Man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, before we become <strong>invisible </strong>ourselves, how about we go through today&apos;s words?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Marvellous. First we had <strong>invisible </strong>&#x2013; which meansimpossible to see. You could say that stars are <strong>invisible</strong> during the day.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>They&apos;re only visible at night.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We also had <strong>cloak</strong> &#x2013; who would wear a cloak? Maybe a king or a monk? Or maybe you, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m sure I could look good in a <strong>cloak</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s a long piece of material worn over the shoulders. What about <strong>illusion</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>Illusions</strong> appear to be true, but they&apos;re not. It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the <strong>illusion</strong> that everything he says is true. Then we had <strong>mismatch</strong> &#x2013; which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there&apos;s a <strong>mismatch</strong> between what Michael says and what he does.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Who&apos;s Michael?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Just an example! You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple &#x2013; they seem very different &#x2013; they&apos;re a bit of a <strong>mismatch</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What is it with you and Michael?! One, he doesn&apos;t exist, and two, I think you&apos;re being <strong>judgemental</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m criticising him so, yeah, you&apos;re right &#x2013; I&apos;m being <strong>judgemental</strong>. Perhaps I should stop. It&apos;s just that&#x2026; it&apos;s just that I&apos;m in love with Simone myself, and I get all nervous and <strong>self-conscious</strong> when I see her.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you &#x2013; you become <strong>self-conscious</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I do.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Even though she doesn&apos;t exist either?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, only in my examples. Sometimes I wish I really did have an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hey, hang on, Dan - where have you gone?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Haha &#x2013; very funny, I&apos;m still perfectly visible. Time to go &#x2013; but do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Goodbye for now.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
