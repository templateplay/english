<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob...<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>...and I&apos;m Neil. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, Neil! Now, Neil, could I borrow your phone charger? My phone&apos;s just died.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Er... I don&apos;t think my charger is compatible with your phone. <strong>Compatible</strong> means when you can use things together&#x2026; I&apos;m afraid there&apos;ll be no status updates for you today then Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh dear. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s run out of power already.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you shouldn&#x2019;t have bought a state-of-the-art phone &#x2013; it&apos;s a big drain on the battery.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>State of the art</strong> means something that has the newest ideas and features, like my phone. So I should have stuck with a dinosaur like yours, eh, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And<strong> dinosaur</strong> here means something that is out-dated. You can laugh at my phone, but it&apos;s got plenty of battery life left &#x2013; unlike yours!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hmmm... OK, well, I might just pop out and ask if someone&apos;s got the same charger&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Stay where you are. We&apos;re recording a programme! And today&apos;s show is&#x2026; you guessed it&#x2026; all about phones!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s right, Neil. And we&apos;re also talking about <strong>wireless furniture</strong>&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, furniture with built-in wireless charging technology - like a coffee table. <strong>Built in</strong> means the technology is included as part of the table. So you just pop your phone on the table, and technology does the rest!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Magic! And <strong>wireless technology</strong> is the way mobile phones work using radio waves to send and receive data. So that&apos;s what we need - a desk with a built-in charging spot for both our phones! But would it be compatible for both of them?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s an excellent question - and I don&apos;t have the answer. But can you tell me the answer to this: What do modern phone batteries contain? Is it...</p>
<p>a) nickel</p>
<p>b) lithium</p>
<p>or c) lead-acid</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, lead-acid sounds dangerous... so I think it&apos;s either nickel or lithium. I&apos;ll go with lithium.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well, we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right or wrong later on. But now let&apos;s listen to journalist Daisy Buchanan who thinks that mobile phones have stopped us having conversations. And listen out for a phrase that means &apos;it&apos;s unlikely to happen soon&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Daisy Buchanan, writer for the Telegraph &amp; the Guardian newspapers<br></strong>I was thinking yesterday how it used to be, you know, you used to sort of go into a caf&#xE9; or a pub maybe and look for where the loos are but now the first thing we&apos;re looking for is sockets to try and find where you can charge if you... you know, if you&apos;re having an emergency... And maybe with this, I might be being na&#xEF;ve - I suspect I am - especially with Ikea&apos;s new wireless charging furniture... that maybe if our batteries died a bit more frequently we are going to... you know... look up a bit more and have a few more conversations. I&apos;m not holding my breath, but you can but hope.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Daisy said some really interesting things there, so let&apos;s listen to that clip again.</p>
<p><strong><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Daisy Buchanan, writer for the Telegraph &amp; the Guardian newspapers<br></strong></strong>I was thinking yesterday how it used to be, you know, you used to sort of go into a caf&#xE9; or a pub maybe and look for where the loos are but now the first thing we&apos;re looking for is sockets to try and find where you can charge if you... you know, if you&apos;re having an emergency... And maybe with this, I might be being na&#xEF;ve - I suspect I am - especially with Ikea&apos;s new wireless charging furniture... that maybe if our batteries died a bit more frequently we are going to... you know... look up a bit more and have a few more conversations. I&apos;m not holding my breath, but you can but hope.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Did you get it? Another way of saying &apos;It&apos;s unlikely to happen soon&apos; is <strong>I&apos;m not holding my breath</strong>. Now, Daisy doesn&apos;t seem keen on the idea of wireless charging furniture. She thinks our phones are stopping us from having conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It sounds ridiculous, but it&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it? We spend far too much time staring at our phones instead of talking to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Sorry. What&apos;s that, Neil? I was just looking at my phone.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Come on, Rob! Put the phone away.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, that&apos;s because phone <strong>functionality</strong> - that&apos;s what a phone can do - is increasing all the time. But let&apos;s move on now and <strong>think green</strong> for a minute. Are there any environmental factors to consider in relation to new mobile phone technology?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Let&apos;s listen to Fevzi Turkalp talking about the latest model of one mobile phone brand - and find out.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Fevzi Turkalp, editor of tech advice website GadgetDetective.com<br></strong>They&apos;ve taken the decision to make it a sealed unit so no user-replaceable battery... And I guess... you&apos;re more likely then to say you know what I won&apos;t replace the battery I&apos;ll just get a new phone.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So Fevzi says this new phone doesn&apos;t have a <strong>user-replaceable</strong> battery, meaning you can&apos;t take it out and replace it - and this is a problem for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s right - environmentalists want products that are designed to be taken apart. Then they can be easily upgraded, repaired or recycled. But you can&apos;t do this with a <strong>sealed unit</strong> - a unit that cannot be opened.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And this means <strong>toxic</strong> - or poisonous - materials are often dumped in landfill. And you guessed it &#x2013; that&apos;s really bad for the environment. Now, remember at the beginning of the programme I asked you: What do modern phone batteries contain?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said lithium...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you know your batteries well because that&apos;s the right answer!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Wow. What a great guess! Now Rob, how about those words again?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, the words we heard today were:</p>
<p>compatible</p>
<p>state of the art</p>
<p>dinosaur</p>
<p>wireless furniture</p>
<p>built in</p>
<p>wireless technology</p>
<p>I&apos;m not holding my breath</p>
<p>functionality</p>
<p>think green</p>
<p>user-replaceable</p>
<p>sealed unit</p>
<p>toxic</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, that brings us to the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. We hope you&apos;re feeling charged up by today&apos;s programme. Please join us again soon.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.</p></div>
