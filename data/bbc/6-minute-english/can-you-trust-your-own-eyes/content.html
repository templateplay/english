<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Catherine&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Have you done your hair differently?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Is that a new outfit?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Honestly, Neil!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I give up. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s different about you.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you&apos;ll have figured it out. Anyway, today we&apos;re discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today&apos;s quiz question, Neil?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I am.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) the temporal lobe?<br>b) the hypothalamus?<br>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I have no idea. But I&apos;ll say a) the temporal lobe.<br><strong><br> Catherine<br></strong>OK and we&apos;ll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let&apos;s talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn&apos;t work like that. It&apos;s a reconstructive process.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A reconstructive process?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. We <strong>reconstruct</strong>&#xA0;- or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be <strong>distorted</strong> &#x2013; or changed &#x2013; for different reasons. Let&apos;s listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith&apos;s College at the University of London, talking about this.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith&apos;s College, University of London <br></strong>From all those TV dramas you&apos;ve watched you&apos;ll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don&apos;t introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don&apos;t distort their memory.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don&apos;t contaminate it with their DNA.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That&apos;s right. A <strong>crime scene</strong> is a place where a crime was committed. And <strong>contaminated</strong> means &apos;made impure through contact with an outside source&apos;. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can&apos;t get back to the original information.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness&apos;s memory of what happened.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And it isn&apos;t only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you&apos;re being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker&apos;s face. And <strong>at knifepoint </strong>means &apos;under threat of being stabbed&apos;.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?<br><br><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court &#x2013; but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. <span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York,</span> explains this further.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York<br></span></strong><span>First, I think it&apos;s sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It&apos;s very disconcerting to think that we&apos;re going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be - and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it&apos;s disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And <strong>disconcerting</strong></span><span> means&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>&#x2026;it means &apos;confusing and a bit upsetting&apos;.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness<strong> testimony </strong>&#x2013; or spoken statements &#x2013; in court. Do you think that&apos;s true, Catherine?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes &#x2013; and it&apos;s the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Are there any ways to improve accuracy?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I see. Well, you didn&apos;t give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, that&apos;s true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that... I&apos;m wearing glasses, Neil. I&apos;ve lost my contact lenses!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&apos;t know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Just a bit, yes. So, now we&apos;re running out of time, so let&apos;s move onto the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) the temporal lobe?<br>b) the hypothalamus?<br>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces &#x2013; called the Fusiform Face Area &#x2013; is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area just behind your ears.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today&#x2026;<br>reconstruct<br>distorted<br>crime scene<br>contaminated<br>at knifepoint<br>disconcerting<br>testimony<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that bring us to the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!</p></div>
