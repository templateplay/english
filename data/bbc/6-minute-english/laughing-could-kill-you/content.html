<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an entertaining topic and six related items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Neil&#x2026; and those guffaws you can hear are coming from Tim. So what&apos;s so funny, Tim?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Can you pass me a glass of water?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, OK, here you go.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>It was just something our producer said before I came into the studio. A <strong>guffaw</strong> by the way is a loud laugh that you can&apos;t control...<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So while Tim <strong>laughs his head off</strong> &#x2013; and that means to laugh very loudly for a long time &#x2013; I&apos;ll introduce the show. Today, Tim, we&apos;re talking about laughter and how it could kill you&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Oh come on, Neil! That&apos;s not funny! Laughing is good for you &#x2013; everyone knows that!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, not when you laugh like that, Tim! You&apos;re bright red in the face, you&apos;ve got tears streaming down your face. And you nearly choked on a glass of water! <strong>Choke </strong>means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat by the way. Now, without laughing or choking, can you please tell me how many times a day the average adult laughs? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 17,<br>b) 70 or<br>c) 700?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Hmm. Surely it depends on what type of person you are?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Maybe it does. That&apos;s why I&apos;m asking about the average number of times Tim, so just make an intelligent guess.<br><br><strong>Tim<br></strong>OK, well I laugh a lot so I&apos;m going to say 70 times a day. 700 times seems like you&apos;d be laughing all the time&#x2026; But you&apos;ve worried, me Neil &#x2013; I know we sometimes say, I nearly died laughing &#x2013; but nobody does actually die laughing, do they?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I think the risk of dying of laughter is probably low &#x2013; but in theory, what happens when we laugh is potentially dangerous! Let&apos;s listen to cognitive neuroscientist Sophie Scott talking about what happens when we laugh.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Sophie Scott, cognitive neuroscientist<br></strong>Laughter &#x2013; in a competition for control over your ribcage in your brain between laughter and breathing and speaking &#x2013; laughter will always win. And laughter just takes those same muscles and it squeezes them &#x2013; eh eh eh eh &#x2013; and the air goes &#x2013; out out out out &#x2013; and notably it does not want to let you breathe in. It&apos;s trying to kill you. It&apos;s quite dangerous.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>So when you laugh a lot your <strong>diaphragm</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s the sheet of muscle below your lungs &#x2013; contracts and squeezes the air out of your lungs.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>This makes it hard to breathe &#x2013; which is why you were gasping for breath earlier, Tim! And that&apos;s why laughter can kill you!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong><strong>Gasping</strong> means having difficulty breathing. Well, I&apos;ve caught my breath now &#x2013; I didn&apos;t die &#x2013; and I think it&apos;s fair to say, Neil, that laughter is good for you. When you laugh, your body releases happy hormones&#x2026; And according to some research, people feel less pain as a result of having a good laugh.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So scientists are saying laughter is a sort of natural painkiller?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br> </strong>Apparently, yes. They&apos;ve done research where they make people laugh, and then test their pain levels afterwards. And they found that if people only chuckle a bit it doesn&apos;t act as a painkiller, but if you laugh a lot, it does.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So a chuckle sounds like this [chuckles]. <strong>Chuckling</strong> means to laugh quietly. So you need belly laughter then &#x2013; great big guffaws?<br><br><strong>Tim<br></strong>That&apos;s right. A guffaw is pretty much the opposite of a chuckle. I was guffawing earlier in the show. Would you like to demonstrate your own guffaw, Neil?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>[hearty guffaw]<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Fantastic &#x2013; can I try pinching you now, and test whether you feel any pain?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, you can&apos;t, Tim. It&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked you:<span><br></span></p>
<p>How many times a day does the average adult laugh? Is it&#x2026; a) 17, b) 70 or c) 700?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>I said 70&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sorry. The right answer is actually 17 &#x2013; less than you thought I&apos;m afraid, Tim. But children laugh on average 300 times a day.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>That&apos;s a big difference! You see, Neil, we all need to laugh more. You shouldn&apos;t be trying to tell us that laughing is dangerous.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Maybe you&apos;re right. So let&apos;s move on and go over the words we learned today. The first one is &apos;guffaw&apos; &#x2013; which is a loud laugh that you can&apos;t control...<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;Neil surprised us with his deep guffaw.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Next up &#x2013; number two &#x2013; to &apos;laugh your head off&apos; &#x2013; means to laugh very loudly for a long time.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;It&apos;s a really funny movie &#x2013; you&apos;ll laugh your head off!&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK &#x2013; number three &#x2013; &apos;choke&apos; means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;I nearly choked to death on a cheese sandwich.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Poor Tim &#x2013; you should eat more slowly! &apos;Diaphragm&apos; is our next word, and that&apos;s the sheet of muscle separating your lungs from your stomach. We use our diaphragms for breathing, talking, and laughing!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;Do opera singers have more powerful diaphragms than other people?&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&apos;t know the answer to that, Tim. So number five, which is &apos;gasping&apos;, which means having&#xA0;difficulty breathing. &#x201C;He was gasping for breath as he swam to the surface of the swimming pool.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>But &apos;gasp&apos; also means to be shocked or surprised by something. For example, &#x201C;I gasped in astonishment when I heard Neil laugh.&#x201D;<span data-mce-mark="1"><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Our final word is &apos;chuckle&apos; which means to laugh quietly.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;The audience chuckled through the show but they didn&apos;t seem very amused.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh dear. Well I hope our audience has been amused today. If you&apos;re looking for more laughs, then please check out our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. You may find something to make you chuckle or guffaw there.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim and Neil<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
