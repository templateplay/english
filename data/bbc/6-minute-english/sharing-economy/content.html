I&apos;m Finn, and Rob&apos;s here too.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, hello.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Hi. Rob - tell me - do you have a spare room in your house?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Absolutely not. We&apos;re full to capacity in our house.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>And what about a <strong>driveway</strong> for your car?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>A driveway - so you mean a parking space off the road at my house? Not exactly a driveway, but yes I do have a parking space, yes.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well - both of these are ways of making money in the &apos;sharing economy&apos;. Interested? Well, we&apos;ll be talking about this new economy in the programme, and learning some language related to making money. But first - a question.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Great. I don&apos;t have to pay for it do I?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>It&apos;s a free question. But no prize either.&#xA0;In February 2014, Britain&apos;s most expensive parking space went on sale, but for how much? Was it:</p><p>a) &#xA3;80,000</p><p>b) &#xA3;100,000&#xA0;</p><p>c) &#xA3;400,000</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well, it&apos;s just a parking space isn&apos;t it? So I&apos;m going to go for the lowest value: &#xA3;80,000.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>&#xA3;80,000 - still a lot of money. We&apos;ll find out if that&apos;s the right answer at the end of the programme. But first, let&apos;s find out a bit more about this sharing economy. Rob, are you <strong>feeling the pinch</strong>?&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Feeling the pinch - you mean feeling poor. Yes, I&apos;m always feeling the pinch. So come on Finn, tell us how we can make some money.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, perhaps the best-known example of a company in the sharing economy is Airbnb - it&apos;s an American web business which allows you to rent out your spare room to <strong>holidaymakers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>OK. Holidaymakers - so these are people on holiday. Using your spare room as a B and B - that&apos;s a bed and breakfast?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes - you can provide breakfast for your guests too...&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>That sounds like a clever way to <strong>make a few pennies</strong>.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, to make a few pennies - to make a bit of extra money.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>OK well, Airbnb say they operate in 34,000 cities and have 800,000 listings of rooms and apartments. In fact, we could say they&apos;re the <strong>market-leader </strong>in this industry - the main, most successful company.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>There are many companies doing very similar things. And one doing something with parking spaces is JustPark. It&apos;s a British business that lets you rent out your driveway or parking space.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Another way to make money <strong>on the side</strong> - which means to make some extra money in addition to your normal job. We&apos;re going to hear from the founder of JustPark now, Anthony Eskinazi. Where did the idea for the business come from?</p><p><strong>Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark<br clear="none"></strong>When I had the original idea, I spotted a driveway close to a sports stadium. It would have been so convenient if I could have just parked in that driveway rather than in a <strong>commercial </strong>car park.<em>&#xA0;</em></p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>So, Anthony said that he got the idea when trying to park near a stadium. He said he saw a driveway. He thought it would be more convenient to just park there than in a commercial car park - a normal one which makes money.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>So he set up this site. And around 20,000 people have put their spaces on the site, and he says around half a million drivers use it.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Interestingly, a church near Kings Cross in central London has apparently made over &#xA3;200,000 by renting out space in its yard to travellers!<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>And of course there are other sites doing very similar things, like Uber and Lyft - these let drivers share their cars with other passengers.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>And there&apos;s even a company in Hong Kong which lets you share space under your umbrella when it rains!&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That sounds like <strong>one for a rainy day</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Haha - an idea to store away until you need it. But I do have a question. What about the people who run things like traditional B and Bs, or commercial car parks - or taxi services - things like that? Won&apos;t they be <strong>out of pocket</strong>?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Out of pocket, yes - lose money. Many of them are out of pocket and are not happy about this. And there is another issue: <strong>regulations</strong> - or laws. Listen to the editor of <em>Tech City News</em>, Alex Wood. Why are regulations for these new businesses unclear?</p><p><strong>Alex Wood, editor of Tech City News<br clear="none"></strong>Take the example of someone who has a driveway in their house. They&apos;ve got some spare capacity there - they&apos;re looking to make some more money. But how does that affect their neighbours? How does that affect the Council and the regulation and the rules around them? Because this is a new business world, those rules aren&apos;t there yet.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, he says they&apos;re unclear - because the rules aren&apos;t there yet. Because it&apos;s a whole new business world.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>In fact, Airbnb has had problems with the law. But, in a time when the economy is doing badly, these businesses seem to be <strong>thriving</strong> - doing really well - and provide an extra <strong>source of income</strong> for many people.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That&apos;s right. Many are benefitting from this new economy. But others are out of pocket. That&apos;s business. Rob, what about us? Could you make some money from this sharing economy? You could rent out your bike - your lovely folding bike - while you&apos;re at work?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>That&apos;s a really good idea - it&apos;s kind of a downtime, the bike&apos;s not being used, so why not! Anyway - how about the answer to today&apos;s question?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, earlier I asked you about the most expensive parking space ever to go on sale in London. How much was it on sale for?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well, I had a guess and I said &#xA3;80,000.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, you were completely wrong. It was the most expensive one: &#xA3;400,000.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>No way! For a parking space!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>It was a space in London, in Kensington and it went on sale for &#xA3;400,000, which is over twice the price of the average UK house. So very expensive! Anyway, Rob, before we go any further, how about those words again?&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>OK, the words we&apos;ve heard today were:</p><p>driveway</p><p>feeling the pinch</p><p>holidaymakers</p><p>make a few pennies</p><p>on the side</p><p>market leader</p><p>one for a rainy day</p><p>out of pocket</p><p>regulations</p><p>thriving</p><p>source of income</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Thank you Rob.
