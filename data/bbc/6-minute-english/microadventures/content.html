<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello I&apos;m Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic and authentic listening practice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>...and don&apos;t forget vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I&apos;m Neil by the way and today we&apos;re off on an adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>But not a very big adventure Neil &#x2013; it&apos;s just a mini or microadventure &#x2013; but if you have <strong>wanderlust</strong> &#x2013; a strong desire to travel &#x2013; I think it may appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It will appeal to you Rob because you love to travel &#x2013; haven&apos;t you circumnavigated the globe &#x2013; I mean go all the way round the world?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Almost Neil &#x2013; but today&apos;s mini-adventure doesn&apos;t involve travelling too far from home. We&apos;ll explore the topic more in a moment but not before we&apos;ve set today&apos;s quiz question. So Neil do you know how far it is around the world measured at the equator &#x2013; in other worlds the circumference? It is approximately&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) 30,000 km<br>b) 40,000 km, or<br>c) 50,000 km</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I haven&apos;t walked it but I know it&apos;s a long way &#x2013; so I&apos;ll go for c) 50,000 km.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I shall keep you in suspense and tell you the answer at the end of the programme. Our topic for discussion won&apos;t be travelling so far &#x2013; it&apos;s about a new trend for small adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What you mean are shorter breaks, closer to home. They&apos;re less expensive of course but also instil <strong>a sense of adventure</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s the feeling of doing a new, exciting and sometimes dangerous activity.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, adventurer, Alastair Humphreys has coined the phrase &apos;microadventures&apos; to describe this. &apos;<strong>To coin</strong>&apos; here means to use a word or phrase that no one has used before.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now he&apos;s someone who goes on big trips and expeditions to the four corners of the globe and writing books about his adventures. But he wanted to prove you don&apos;t have to go far to find adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Let&apos;s hear from him now &#x2013; speaking on BBC Radio 4&apos;s You and Yours programme &#x2013; about what he did. How did he describe his first microadventure?</p>
<p><strong>Alastair Humphreys, adventurer<br></strong>I&apos;d been doing big adventures for years and I had this hunch that you didn&apos;t need to go to the ends of the world to have some sort of adventure. You didn&apos;t need to be in beautiful Patagonia to have the spirit of adventure. So I decided to try and prove my theory by doing the most boring, ugly adventure I could think of. And I came up with the idea of walking a lap of the M25 in the snow in January. And time and again as I walked round the M25 I just kept thinking to myself this experience is exactly the same as the four years I spent cycling round the world. Smaller, of course, a bit silly, but definitely felt like an adventure And that&apos;s when I really started to come up with the idea of microadventures.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So a microadventure is a boring, ugly adventure?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No Neil. It may not be glamourous but it is an adventure. He walked around the London orbital motorway &#x2013; called the M25 &#x2013; to prove his <strong>hunch</strong> that you don&apos;t need to go far to find adventure. A hunch is an idea you have based on feelings but there&apos;s no proof.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well his hunch was right. But walking alongside a motorway isn&apos;t my idea of adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It doesn&apos;t have to be Neil. Just getting out on your bike and exploring somewhere in your locality that you haven&apos;t visited before is an adventure. And how about camping?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah yes, I do like to camp out &#x2013; that&apos;s a phrasal verb to mean sleep outside in a tent. You can be so close to nature and breathe in the fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yep and you don&apos;t need to go far for a camping adventure &#x2013; and being out a night really adds to the sense of adventure. That&apos;s what Alastair Humphreys believes&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alastair Humphreys, adventurer<br></strong>We humans are so boring these days &#x2013; we so rarely spend time out in the darkness to see the stars and to see how the world feels different by night. I get a little bit nervous still &#x2013; I still imagine ghosts &#x2013; but that&apos;s part of the charm of making a little frisson of adventure. And then in the morning the sun comes up, the birds sing, jump in a river, back on the bus, back to your desk for 9.00.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Seeing how the world feels at night is a nice idea. Getting a bit nervous &#x2013; anxious maybe &#x2013; is part of the pleasure or enjoyment &#x2013; what Alastair calls &apos;<strong>charm</strong>&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I agree &#x2013; and he used another word &apos;frisson&apos; meaning a sudden, strong feeling of excitement, or fear.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>My biggest fear would be returning to my desk for 9.00! But Alastair is right, there is an adventure to be had <strong>on your doorstep</strong> &#x2013; that means close to where you live.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But only a small adventure Rob! Unlike an adventure round the circumference of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes that was my question earlier: how far it is around the world measured at the equator &#x2013; in other worlds the circumference? It is approximately&#x2026;</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 30,000 km<br>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 40,000 km, or<br>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 50,000 km</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I said c) 50,000 km.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Sorry Neil &#x2013; too far. The Earth&apos;s circumference has been calculated to be 40,075km. To travel that distance would be a major adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>OK, I think we should remind ourselves of the some of the words and phrases we&apos;ve discussed today &#x2013; starting with <strong>wanderlust </strong>&#x2013; a strong desire to travel. &quot;Rob has wanderlust, he&apos;s never at home!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s because I have <strong>a sense of adventure</strong>. That&apos;s the feeling of doing a new, exciting and sometimes dangerous activity. &quot;Neil has no sense of adventure because he likes his holidays to be planned out with no surprises!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s a little unfair Rob &#x2013; I just like to be &apos;holiday happy&apos; &#x2013; that&apos;s a term I&apos;ve just <strong>coined</strong>, which means used a word or phrase that no one has used before. You can also say &apos;to coin a phrase&apos; after using an expression that is well known and possibly used too much.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Next we heard <strong>hunch</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s an idea you have based on feelings but there&apos;s no proof. &quot;I have a hunch Neil wants to go to the pub &#x2013; he&apos;s packing his bag!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Your hunch is correct Rob. But not before we recap our next word <strong>charm</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s part of the pleasure or enjoyment of something. &quot;Part of the charm of going to the seaside is eating ice cream and walking down the pier.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And finally we heard<strong> on your doorstep - </strong>that means close to where you live. &quot;There&apos;s a pub right on your doorstep, so why don&apos;t you make the most of it!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> I intend to Rob but first let me to remind you that you can learn English with us at bbclearningenglish.com. That&apos;s it for today&apos;s 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye.</p></div>
