<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Sophie&#x2026;&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Neil. So, Sophie, the subject of today&apos;s show is attraction &#x2013; do you believe in love at first sight?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>No, I don&apos;t. I think it takes time to get to know somebody well enough to know if you love them. But I have a friend who says when she saw her husband for the first time&#x2026;&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That was before they got married?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>That&apos;s right &#x2013; when they met for the first time, that was it: a bolt out of the blue. And they got married three months later.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A<strong> bolt out of the blue </strong>means something totally unexpected. Well, that sounds very romantic. And leads me on to today&apos;s quiz question. Sophie, what percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it...<br>a) 26%?<br>b) 56%?<br>Or c) 86%?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I&apos;m not an old romantic like you Neil, so I&apos;m going to go for a) 26%.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out later on in the show if you&apos;re right to be sceptical or not, Sophie. And <strong>sceptical</strong> for those of you who don&apos;t know, means to have doubts about something.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I think you can be physically attracted to somebody straight away. I just don&apos;t think you can fall in love with somebody so easily. Love is about other things: compatibility, personality and a good sense of humour.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, humour is important, but apparently, Sophie, for men it&apos;s all about the waist-hip ratio. According to research, the ideal waist-hip ratio for women is 0.7 &#x2013; where <strong>ratio</strong> means the relationship between two sizes &#x2013; and you get this figure by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I see. And why do men find 0.7 so irresistible?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, let&apos;s listen to Dr Anna Machin, an Evolutionary Anthropologist from the University of Oxford, explaining what a man is looking for.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Dr Anna Machin, Evolutionary Anthropologist, University of Oxford<br></strong>He&apos;s going to look for signs for fertility and what we call fecundity and good health. And the major indicator of that in women is the waist-hip ratio. And the waist-hip ratio &#x2013; the absolute ideal &#x2013; what men find most attractive regardless of culture &#x2013; this has been tested in many different cultures round the world &#x2013; is 0.7 and that&apos;s really your classic hourglass figure. And the reason why that universally is attractive is because it&apos;s tied to the health of that individual. There&apos;s a very strong relationship between someone circulating oestrogen and testosterone &#x2013; obviously you want the oestrogen to be high and the testosterone to be low for a woman to be fertile, and also her general health, so .7 is linked to lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of diabetes and certain sorts of cancers.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So a waist-hip ratio of 0.7 <strong>correlates</strong> &#x2013; or has a strong relationship &#x2013; with good general health and fertility in women.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>And men find this attractive because it identifies <strong>fertile</strong> women &#x2013; women who will be able to <strong>conceive</strong> &#x2013; or get pregnant &#x2013; and have babies successfully.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dr Machin also mentions that 0.7 is the classic <strong>hourglass figure</strong> &#x2013; which means curvy!&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Do you like curves, Neil?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Mind your own business, Sophie. But all this waist-hip theory of attraction isn&apos;t very romantic, is it?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>You&apos;re right, it isn&apos;t. And whilst we do judge people by the way they look &#x2013; we also use our sense of smell to sniff out our ideal <strong>mate</strong> &#x2013; or sexual partner. Apparently, we can detect whether people are genetically different to us by the way they smell. And parents who have different immune systems create healthier babies.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So it&apos;s back to having babies again &#x2013; all biology and chemistry &#x2013; and not about feelings at all.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, let&apos;s leave chemistry behind for a moment and listen to Professor David Perrett, at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland. He talks about other factors that play a role in attraction.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>David Perrett, Professor at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland <br> </strong>Plastic surgery really doesn&apos;t count for much in the end. You could be with somebody who&apos;s aesthetically very beautiful but if they don&apos;t smile or react then that counts for much less. So we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner, and that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What does <strong>aesthetically </strong>mean, Sophie?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>It means judging something by the way it looks. And whilst we all enjoy a pretty face, most of us are looking for more than that. We are looking for people who appear friendly and approachable, and who we share interests with.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly &#x2013; and personally, I think kind eyes are very important &#x2013; with a bit of a twinkle. What about you, Sophie?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I like a good sense of humour.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Very good. Now, remember I asked you, Sophie: What percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it&#x2026; a) 26%, b) 56% or c) 86%?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>I said 26%.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sorry, that&apos;s the wrong answer, Sophie. 56% of Americans believe in love at first sight, and the percentage is even higher for married people and those in relationships, according to a poll conducted by the website CBS.com in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, Americans are a romantic bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Me too, and I&apos;m British. Now, here are the words we heard today.<br>bolt out of the blue<br>sceptical<br>ratio<br>correlates<br>fertile<br>conceive<br>hourglass figure<br>mate<br>aesthetically</p>
