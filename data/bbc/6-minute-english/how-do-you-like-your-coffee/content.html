<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello, I&apos;m Catherine. Welcome to Six Minute English where we engage in some lively debate and discuss six stimulating items of vocabulary! And let&apos;s start. Here&apos;s your cup of coffee, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks! But what took you so long, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Sorry Rob. I bumped into somebody I knew in the caf&#xE9; and stopped for a chat.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well, that fits well with today&apos;s show where we&apos;re talking about caf&#xE9;s or coffee houses. Did you know, Catherine, that coffee houses were originally a meeting place for lively debate and intellectual discussion?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really. I didn&apos;t know that, Rob. A <strong>debate</strong>, by the way, means a discussion that a lot of people take part in. So how long ago was this debating society?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>The first coffee house was set up in Oxford in 1650. But they quickly became popular and soon they were all over London too. You paid a penny to get in, and this included access to newspapers &#x2013; and stimulating conversation!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>If something is <strong>stimulating</strong> it encourages ideas and enthusiasm. I expect the coffee helped with that a bit did it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It certainly helps me first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Which brings me on to today&apos;s question, Rob! How many cups of coffee do we consume in coffee shops or stores in the UK every year? <strong>Consume</strong>, by the way, is another word for eat or drink. Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 2.3 million<br>b) 23 million or<br>c) 23 billion?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh I don&apos;t know but it&apos;s got to be a lot so I&apos;m going to go for c) 23 billion? That sounds like a lot of coffee, but I buy several cups a week &#x2013; and I expect you do too, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I do indeed. But I have to say, while I was getting our coffees earlier, there was nobody else in the caf&#xE9; talking except me and my friend. Everybody was sitting on their own, tapping away on their laptops. Let&apos;s listen now to Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland&apos;s Business and Economy Editor, describing the <strong>vibe</strong> &#x2013; or atmosphere &#x2013; in a typical 21st century caf&#xE9;&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland&apos;s Business and Economy Editor<br></strong>Ten or so in the morning, the caf&#xE9; has five people at tables with their backs to the wall, each staring into a screen, plugged in, ears plugged. The flow of bytes through this coffee shop&apos;s free wifi is transporting these customers to diverse destinations far from the person beside them. Collaborative working, a research grant application, a potential blockbuster novel, and inevitably, someone distracted by kitten pictures on social media.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So the spirit of those 17th century coffee houses has disappeared then? No more lively debate and intellectual discussion?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It seems so Rob. As Douglas Fraser says, many people sit alone plugged into their laptops &#x2013; and they&apos;re all doing different things &#x2013; working, writing, messing about on social media.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I think the caf&#xE9; owners should turn off the free wifi and force these caf&#xE9; squatters to move on! I don&apos;t think people should be allowed to sit all day using the internet &#x2013; hogging tables &#x2013; and not talking to anybody! Especially when some of them don&apos;t even buy a coffee!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That&apos;s a bit extreme, Rob. Caf&#xE9; owners need customers &#x2013; and they encourage people to stay by having comfy sofas and newspapers to read and the free wifi! A <strong>squatter</strong>, by the way, is someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. And if you <strong>hog</strong> something you use most or all of it in a selfish way.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I suppose you&apos;re right. Now, how about telling us the answer to today&apos;s question then?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I asked: How many cups of coffee do we consume in caf&#xE9;s or stores in the UK every year? Is it&#x2026; a) 2.3 million b) 23 million or c) 23 billion?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I could sit in a cafe and use their free wifi to research the answer but I had a guess and said 23 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well you didn&apos;t need that free wifi Rob because you were absolutely right! 23 billion coffees per year works out on average as 45 cups per adult in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, I think it&apos;s time we looked back at the words we learned today. Our first word is &apos;debate&apos; &#x2013; a discussion that a lot of people take part in.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>For example, &apos;I took part in a number of stimulating debates at school.&apos; Number two &#x2013; if something is &apos;stimulating&apos;, it encourages new ideas and enthusiasm. For example, &apos;It&apos;s hard to have a stimulating conversation with someone who&apos;s looking at their phone all the time.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s very true &#x2013; let me just slide my phone into my pocket&#x2026; there! Our next word is &apos;consume&apos; &#x2013; another word for eating or drinking &#x2013; but it can also mean &apos;to use&apos;. For example, &apos;My car consumes a lot of petrol.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or, &apos;How do I calculate my car&apos;s fuel consumption?&apos; So &apos;consumption&apos; there is the noun.Number four is &#x2013; &apos;vibe&apos; &#x2013; which means the mood or atmosphere in a place. For example, &apos;Oxford is a city but it has a small-town vibe.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I&apos;m getting bad vibes from our next word &#x2013; which is &apos;squatter&apos; &#x2013; that&apos;s someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. The building is called a &apos;squat&apos; so for example, &apos;I lived in a squat for two years.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really? You squatted in a squat, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No, it was just an example. I&apos;m not a squatter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You&apos;ve never squatted?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No I haven&apos;t. Look we&apos;re wasting time here! We need to move on to our final word &#x2013; hog. If you &apos;hog&apos; something, you use all or most of it in a selfish way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>For example, &apos;Rob! You&apos;ve hogged the only comfy chair! That is so selfish!&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I admit it, Catherine. I&apos;m a chair hog. That&apos;s the noun. OK, before we head off for another cup of coffee please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine/Rob<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
