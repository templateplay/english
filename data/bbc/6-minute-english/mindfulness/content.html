<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, I want you to close your eyes. Focus&#x2026; on your breathing.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Er, Neil? Can we do this later? We&apos;ve only got six minutes.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Ok, Catherine. Welcome to a <strong>mindful</strong></span><span> edition of 6 Minute English, where we&apos;re exploring the rise of </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span> &#x2013; particularly in schools.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we&apos;ll be teaching six items of vocabulary along the way. So I think we should start with <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> itself.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Being <strong>mindful</strong></span><span>, as an adjective, means &apos;being calmly aware of everything in your body and mind&apos;. You only focus on &apos;now&apos;.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>People practise <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>, the noun, by focusing only on their breath, and not allowing themselves to be distracted by passing thoughts.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Indeed. It&apos;s traditionally associated with Buddhism, and has become incredibly popular in the <strong>secular</strong></span><span> world &#x2013; in workplaces, in private classes and even in schools.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span><span> Secular </span></strong><span>means &apos;non-religious&apos; by the way.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, I just mentioned schools: how many teachers in the UK are trained to teach <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>? Is it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) 500,<br></span><span>b) 5,000 or<br></span><span>c) 50,000?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>Let me focus really hard &#x2013; I think it&apos;s 5,000.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>A very <strong>mindful</strong></span><span> answer, Catherine. But I&apos;ll reveal the real answer later. Now let&apos;s hear from one teacher who&apos;s been </span><span>practising <strong>mindfulness </strong><span></span>with students for many years. Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years at Dharma Primary School, thinks it&apos;s particularly suited to young children. Why?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years, Dharma Primary School<br></span></strong><span>That</span><span>&apos;s very natural for children - to be <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>. And we really kind of celebrate that because that is a place where they are learning. So, if they feel </span><strong><span>grounded</span></strong>,<span> then they can really develop their concentration and their focus, and relax. Learning happens so much more easily if you&apos;re relaxed and happy.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Alison said it was natural for children to be <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><strong><span>The present</span></strong><span> &#x2013; means &apos;now&apos;. You&apos;ll know it from the &apos;present tense&apos; in grammar. And people who practise <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> use this phrase a lot &#x2013; to be </span><strong><span>in the present</span></strong><span>, or </span><strong><span>in the present moment</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It sounds simple, but actually it&apos;s very hard to achieve.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, it might be for an old chap like you, but for young people, Miss Mayo thinks it&apos;s very natural.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Fair enough. Being <strong>grounded</strong></span><span>, as she says, helps students concentrate and learn in a relaxed way.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span><strong>Grounded</strong> is another good adjective there &#x2013; it means &apos;rational, sensible, clear thinking&apos;.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So, she&apos;s a fan of <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>. And there&apos;s growing evidence behind its benefits.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes. The UK&apos;s national health advisory body has recommended it to help treat conditions like depression and anxiety.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Studies have shown it reduces levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And a new study has claimed that eating <strong>mindfully</strong></span><span> can actually help people to lose weight.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You mean eating slowly?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yeah, slowly and really experiencing and tasting the food. Not being distracted and not eating too much too fast! Anyway, Neil, is <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> taking over the world?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, not quite yet. There still aren&apos;t many detailed studies on it &#x2013; and some critics say the studies we have show a publication <strong>bias</strong></span><span>. In other words, only the positive results are published.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>A <strong>bias</strong></span><span> is when you support something or someone in an unfair way, because of your preferences or beliefs.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>What seems certain is that <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> has entered into many aspects of modern life, at least here in the UK. Now, let&apos;s look back at our question. I asked how many teachers in the UK have been trained in </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And I said 5,000.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, it was actually 5,000. Well done! According to the <strong>Mindfulness</strong></span><span> Initiative. And it keeps on growing.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So before we finish up, here&apos;s another question that might be useful for our listeners &#x2013; what&apos;s the difference between <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> and </span><strong><span>meditation</span></strong><span>?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Aha &#x2013; that&apos;s not so easy to define. <strong>Meditation</strong></span><span> is the broader term. When you </span><strong><span>meditate</span></strong><span> you spend time quietly &#x2013; focusing your mind - often for relaxation or spiritual purposes. </span><strong><span>Mindfulness</span></strong><span> is a particular a kind of </span><strong><span>meditation</span></strong><span> &#x2013; when you try to empty your mind of thought. Does that make sense?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yeah, more or less. So we&apos;ll let our listeners <strong>meditate</strong></span><span> on that answer. And before we empty our minds, let&apos;s look back at today&apos;s words. We had </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span>, </span><strong><span>mindful</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>mindfully</span></strong><span> &#x2013; they all relate to the particular practice of being only focused of what&apos;s happening now.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>What&apos;s happening now, or we could say &#x2013; what&apos;s happening <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>. People often focus on the past &#x2013; thinking back about mistakes or happy memories&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Or on the future &#x2013; which can be full of worries. But by being <strong>in the present</strong></span><span> &#x2013; you overcome these thoughts and fears. Next we had&#xA0;</span><strong><span>secular</span></strong><span>. It contrasts with &apos;religious&apos;. So, while a church is a religious building, we also have </span><strong><span>secular</span></strong><span> buildings &#x2013; like factories and shops and hospitals&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>All non-religious buildings, in other words!&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. Now, tell me Neil, are you feeling <strong>grounded</strong></span><span> right now?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You&apos;re asking if I&apos;m thinking clearly and feeling connected to the world? Do you even have to ask, Catherine &#x2013; I&apos;m a very <strong>grounded</strong></span><span> person.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>You are, most of the time. Most of the time you&apos;re naturally <strong>grounded</strong></span><span>, every now and again you get a bit panicked, but &#x2026; some of us need to remember to slow down, chill out and </span><strong><span>meditate</span></strong><span> once in a while.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, that would be <strong>meditate</strong></span><span> meaning to take quiet time to focus deeply on something.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. Now for more ways to improve your English I suggest you <strong>mindfully</strong></span><span> visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, focus only on our pages. Don&apos;t be distracted by anything else!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Both<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p></div>
