<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil&#x2026;<br><br></span><span><strong>Alice<br></strong>&#x2026; and I&apos;m Alice. Have you er&#x2026; gained some weight, Neil? You&apos;re not looking in great shape&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m afraid so! My New Year&apos;s resolution is to <strong>get in shape</strong> &#x2013; or to get fit through physical exercise. I look fat, don&apos;t I?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well&#x2026; er&#x2026; Did you overindulge during the Christmas holidays, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&apos;m afraid I did, Alice. <strong>Overindulge</strong> means to have too much of something nice &#x2013; like all that lovely Christmas food!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, lovely. Why do you think appearance is so important to us, Neil? Getting in shape is a very popular <strong>New Year&apos;s resolution </strong>&#x2013; that&apos;s a decision to do or stop doing something at the beginning of the New Year.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Good question. Well, I think we all judge people according to the way they look. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>The subject of today&apos;s show is <strong>appearance</strong> or the way we look. Did you know Neil that better-looking people tend to be judged by others as more intelligent?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That sounds unfair!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>I know. Well, show us you aren&apos;t just a pretty face by getting today&apos;s quiz question right. From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) their hair?<br></span><span>b) their face?<br></span><span>Or c) their height?<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, I&apos;m going for a) hair. I like my hair.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>You have lovely hair, Neil.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And a lot of it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Anyway, we&apos;ll find out later whether you&apos;re right or not. Now, it&apos;s not only people who make quick decisions about others based on the way they look. Some animals do this too. Peahens &#x2013; that&apos;s a female peacock - prefer male peacocks with lots of eyespots on their tail.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Why&apos;s that?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, one theory is that a male peacock&apos;s tail is a sign of his genes. <strong>Genes</strong> are part of the DNA in a cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of an animal. It takes lots of energy to grow a big tail, and to carry it around, so only the strongest, healthiest males can afford to do this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So what do men need in order to attract women, Alice? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>A deep voice and a square jaw, according to research.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, let&apos;s listen now to fashion historian Amber Butchart describing what men used to do to <strong>enhance</strong> &#x2013; or improve &#x2013; their physical appearance. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br>Amber Butchart, fashion historian and analyst<br></strong></span><span>Men quite often would wear corsets throughout [the] 18<sup>th</sup> Century even into the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. It was possibly concerned with displaying status and rank rather than what we now define as physical attractiveness but I think the two were very bound up together. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>This was Amber Butchart. A <strong>corset</strong> is a tight-fitting piece of underwear that squeezes you in and makes your waist look smaller.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I didn&apos;t know men used to wear corsets! That might make you talk in a high voice &#x2013; and that wouldn&apos;t be very&#xA0;attractive, would it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, no, Neil. It&apos;s a very interesting look and sound for you&#x2026; On a more serious note, Amber says that men weren&apos;t wearing these uncomfortable <strong>garments</strong> &#x2013; or clothes &#x2013; just to look more physically attractive &#x2013; they were also doing it to display their status and rank.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span><strong>Status</strong> means the professional or social position of a person in relation to others. And <strong>rank</strong> is another way of saying the same thing. Do you think we still dress to impress, Alice &#x2013; or are things a bit freer than they were in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century? I&apos;m a jeans and T-shirt man, as you know. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well yes, indeed, you don&apos;t have to be <strong>suited and booted</strong> for our job &#x2013; and that means smartly dressed. But I think the way we dress is still important. But for women, particularly, I think we dress nicely for ourselves &#x2013; not for anybody else. Sometimes I put on make-up &#x2013; not because I&apos;m going out &#x2013; but because it makes me feel good.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You always look nice &#x2013; with or without make-up, Alice.<br><br></span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Thank you, Neil! That&apos;s very nice. But let&apos;s listen now to academic Philippa Dietrich from the University of the West of England, Bristol, talking about valuing ourselves for all our attributes &#x2013; not just our appearance.<br><br></span><span><strong>INSERT<br>Philippa Dietrich, University of the West of England, Bristol<br></strong></span><span>This focus just on appearance &#x2013; on looks &#x2013; really sends people the ideas that their bodies are just objects to be looked at. Having a belief system or focussing on your values in life or other attributes or personality characteristics or interests or anything else that&apos;s not to do with appearance is really important. Our bodies are not there to be looked that &#x2013; they have functions.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>What Philippa Dietrich said makes sense to me. We need to focus on our inner beauty. What do you think, Alice?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, I think you should stop posting selfies on social media then, Neil! Now here&apos;s the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked: From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it&#x2026; a) their hair? b) their face? Or c) their height?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And I said a) hair. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And you were wrong I&apos;m afraid, Neil! It&apos;s c) height. A poll conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio found that when it comes to appearance, men were most likely to mention their height - 21% of them in fact said it was their favourite physical attribute whereas for women, 35% of them said their hair was their favourite thing. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, forget about my hair, Alice - I&apos;m tall too, OK, so&#x2026; you can tell us the words we heard today, please?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Here they are:<br></span><span>get in shape<br></span><span>overindulge<br></span><span>New Year&apos;s resolution<br></span><span>appearance<br></span><span>genes<br></span><span>corset<br></span><span>garments<br></span><span>status<br></span><span>rank<br></span><span>suited and booted</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Happy New Year everyone and we hope you keep your New Year&apos;s resolutions! Please join us again soon.</span></p>
