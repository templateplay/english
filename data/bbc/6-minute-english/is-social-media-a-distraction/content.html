<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Sophie&#x2026;</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil? &#x2026; [sound of a smartphone] Neil!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, sorry! &#x2026; And I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil, please put down your phone. We&apos;re doing the show!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah, I know. Hang on a minute. I just need to tweet something and&#x2026; Done!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the subject of today&apos;s show is social media and its impact on our daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm, well, I suppose it has had quite a big impact on mine.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>That&apos;s all too clear. Now, perhaps we can move on to today&apos;s quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Of course &#x2013; I&apos;m all ears. [sound of a smartphone] Oh, hang on, wait a second&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>There&apos;s a word to describe what you&apos;re doing, you know. Answer me this: Which word describes a situation where you&apos;re talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) phobbing?<br>b) phibbing?<br>Or c) phubbing?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you&apos;ve got me there, Sophie! I have no idea! But I&apos;ll guess that it&apos;s c) phubbing!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, let&apos;s move on and talk about phone etiquette &#x2013; <strong>etiquette</strong> means rules of polite behaviour in society or among people in a certain group.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well&#x2026; interrupting conversations to check your phone has become a social norm, hasn&apos;t it, Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Social norms</strong> are the rules of behaviour considered acceptable in a group or society. I don&apos;t agree, Neil! Let&apos;s listen to Professor Sherry Turkle of Massachusetts Institute of Technology talking about social norms amongst students.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Sherry Turkle, American clinical psychologist and professor of the social studies of Science and Technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br></strong>I interviewed hundreds of college students and what they talked about was what some of them called &apos;the rule of three&apos;. And what the rule of three is which is that if you go to dinner with friends, you don&apos;t want to look down at your phone until you see that three people, let&apos;s say you&apos;re six at dinner, are looking up in the conversation. So there&apos;s a new etiquette where you don&apos;t look down unless three people are looking up kind of to keep a little conversation alive.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Professor Sherry Turkle.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Why don&apos;t you try out the rule of three once in a while?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>There are only two of us here, Sophie - do the math! And I&apos;m listening to you&#x2026; mmm&#x2026; let me just send a text message here on my phone ... hang on&#x2026;</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil&#x2026; NEIL! I&apos;m not going to carry on with the show unless you pay attention!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sorry, Sophie. Actually I was just doing that to wind you up. I wasn&apos;t really using my phone&#x2026; Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>And to <strong>wind someone up</strong> means to say or do something deliberately in order to annoy someone. Well, I do get wound up about people constantly checking their devices. Yesterday, I was in a caf&#xE9; and two girls came in. They sat down and started chatting away &#x2013; but not to each other &#x2013; they were tapping away at their devices. And there was no face-to-face conversation at all!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But you can have moments of connection using your devices, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>If you have a<strong> connection </strong>with someone you engage emotionally.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. I was on the train this morning and there were a couple sharing a tablet. They were looking at the screen, and talking about what they saw there. It was very intimate, and they were&#x2026; well&#x2026; very connected. Let&apos;s hear from Ian Sinclair, British poet and filmmaker, talking about a new generation of connected humans.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Iain Sinclair, British writer, poet, and filmmaker<br></strong>Physiologically we&apos;re changing, that almost the neck muscles are tipped over to look down. We&apos;re getting a new kind of human being. And I think &#x2013; maybe I&apos;m not getting it &#x2013; but there is actually a different kind of intimacy emerging in which these instruments are very important.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>So Iain Sinclair says our <strong>physiology</strong> is changing &#x2013; our bodies, our neck muscles are changing &#x2013; to make it easier to look down all the time at our devices! But it isn&apos;t only muscles that might change as a result of our techie habits &#x2013; it&apos;s the way we <strong>interact</strong> &#x2013; or engage with each other too. Ian Sinclair talks about a different kind of intimacy emerging &#x2013; what does he mean, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Our <strong>intimacy</strong> &#x2013; or closeness &#x2013; with other people is somehow connected up with our devices. They&apos;ve become part of us. And I expect some day devices will literally be part of us &#x2013; an implant in our necks or something.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>What a horrible thought!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Let&apos;s have the quiz question again Sophie to take your mind off it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>OK. I asked: Which word describes a situation where you&apos;re talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it? Is it&#x2026;a) phobbing? b) phibbing? Or c) phubbing?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) phubbing.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>You were right, Neil! Well done! It&apos;s a combination of&apos; &apos;phone&apos; and &apos;snubbing&apos; &#x2013; <strong>snub</strong> means to deliberately ignore someone you know. New words formed by putting together parts of existing words are known as blends or portmanteau words. And &apos;phubbing&apos; is starting to appear in some online dictionaries. Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p>
<p>[Silence, as Neil is concentrated on his phone]</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil? OK! I&apos;ll say the words myself:<br>etiquette<br>wind someone up<br>have a connection with someone<br>physiology<br>interact<br>intimacy<br>snub</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to connect with us again soon! Come on Neil, connect with us! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, yeah, hang on, just got to&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br></strong>Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hang on&#x2026; I&apos;ll be with you in a second&#x2026; Yes. OK. Bye!</p></div>
