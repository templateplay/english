<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello, I&apos;m Neil and welcome to 6 Minute English, where today we bring you a serious topic and six items of vocabulary.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And hello, I&apos;m Rob. Now, here&apos;s a serious question for you, Neil. Have you thought about what you&apos;d like to happen when you die?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Interesting way to start the show, Rob&#x2026; No, I haven&apos;t.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, nobody really likes to talk about death, do they?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, it isn&apos;t a fun topic. So, can we talk about something else, please?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Afraid not. Because today&apos;s topic is funerals &#x2013; a <strong>funeral</strong> is a ceremony we hold for a dead person.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And a <strong>ceremony</strong> is a formal event performed on special occasions &#x2013; like a wedding or a graduation &#x2013; or in this case, a funeral.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, let&apos;s start with a quiz question. According to a UK survey, how many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 5%,<br>b) 25% or<br>c) 50%?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I think it&apos;s 25%. I hadn&apos;t thought about it before &#x2013; but I&apos;d definitely prefer my funeral to be a celebration. With my favourite music playing &#x2013; and definitely nobody wearing black&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, strangely enough, a friend of mine went to a funeral recently where the funeral director was dressed as Darth Vader from Star Wars!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm. That sounds wrong. But I guess people are choosing to move away from the traditional funeral &#x2013; you know, in church, people dressed in black, all very quiet&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Darth Vader does wear black, at least! Anyway, let&apos;s hear from Shonnie Sullivan here in the UK talking about the fancy dress funeral she and her sister organized for their mother.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Shonnie</strong>: It was quite unusual as we turned up in fancy dress.<br><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Had your mum left instructions about how she wanted her funeral to be?<br><strong>Shonnie</strong>:Only that we don&apos;t cry, and we&#x2026; to have a party to celebrate her life. Be happy, don&apos;t be sad&#x2026; I was a witch.<br><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How did you look?<br><strong>Shonnie</strong>: Oh, it was just a little black dress and I just had, like, a little fancy witch hat on &#x2013; the same as my sister. And we had a very close friend of the family come as Beetlejuice &#x2013; which was absolutely amazing. He really did go all out for that.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So<strong> fancy dress</strong> - special clothes you wear to an event &#x2013; to look like a famous person or character from a movie. Another word we use is<strong> costume </strong>&#x2013; which is a set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Shonnie and her sister chose a Halloween theme for the funeral and wore witches&apos; costumes &#x2013; little black dresses with special hats.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>A close family relative dressed as Beetlejuice &#x2026; Did he dress as a squashed insect, Neil? I&apos;m confused here!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, Rob. He dressed as Beetlejuice, the main character in a popular 1980s movie. Beetlejuice is a ghost who wears crazy clothes, and has scary hair and make up.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hmm. I haven&apos;t seen the film. But what does Shonnie mean when she says her relative went &#x2018;all out&apos; with his costume?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>To go all out</strong> means to make a big effort &#x2013; and this guy&apos;s costume involved not only special clothes, but special hair and make up too.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Like me.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What do you mean, &apos;like me&apos;?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, I go all out to get my clothes and hair just right for 6 Minute English.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, and, well... you look great, Rob. But unfortunately nobody sees us&#x2026; do they?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, good point. But it&apos;s important to make an effort.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So have you had any thoughts about the sort of funeral <em>you</em> would like to have?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Oooh&#x2026; Yes, I like the thought of my friends and family saying their final goodbyes to me on a beach with a beautiful sunset, listening to Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, well, before you get too carried away with ideas for your own funeral, let&apos;s have the answer to today&apos;s quiz question.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>To get carried away</strong> means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings! I never thought I would get excited about my own funeral&#x2026; But anyway &#x2013; yes, back to today&apos;s question! How many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration? Is it&#x2026; a) 5%, b) 25%, or c) 50%?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said 25%.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No, it&apos;s actually 50%. The market research company ICN found that half of us here in the UK would prefer something different to the traditional funeral.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>More than I expected.OK, shall we look back at the words we have learned today?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. First up &#x2013; &apos;funeral&apos; &#x2013; a ceremony we hold for a dead person. The plural is funerals &#x2013; &quot;Fancy dress funerals aren&apos;t everybody&apos;s cup of tea.&quot; The adjective is &#x2013; funereal &#x2013; notice the stress on the second syllable &#x2013; &quot;Who chose this funereal music? Can we change it to something more cheerful?&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&apos;Not my cup of tea&apos; by the way, is something you don&apos;t enjoy doing.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK &#x2013; &apos;ceremony&apos; &#x2013; a formal event performed on special occasions.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&quot;I didn&apos;t go to my sister&apos;s graduation ceremony.&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>&quot;In the UK, the opening of Parliament is a ceremonious occasion.&quot; Ceremonious is the adjective.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Number three &#x2013; &apos;fancy dress&apos; is special clothing you wear to an event &#x2013; for example, to look like a famous person or character from a movie.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>&quot;I&apos;ve been invited to a fancy dress party.&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Who are you going to go as, Rob?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It&apos;s a secret, Neil!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Number four &#x2013; &#x2018;costume&apos; &#x2013; a set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else. &quot;Rob is going to go to the fancy-dress party in a Superman costume.&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Good guess. Right. Number five &#x2013; &apos;to go all out&apos; means to make a big effort.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&quot;We went all out this year with our Christmas decorations &#x2013; with a life-size flashing Santa Claus and sleigh.&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Way to go, Neil! Number six &#x2013; the phrasal verb &apos;to get carried away&apos; &#x2013; means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&quot;She got carried away and painted the whole house pink.&quot;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That must be Barbie&apos;s house&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yup &#x2013; and fancy dress is definitely Barbie&apos;s cup of tea! OK, that&apos;s all for today. But please remember to check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Bye-bye!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Goodbye!</p></div>
