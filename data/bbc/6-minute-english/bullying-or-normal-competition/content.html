<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Hello, I&apos;m Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m joined today by Neil. Hello, Neil!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hi there, Rob! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Today we are talking about a very serious topic: bullying. And you&apos;re going to learn some vocabulary related to this topic.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It&apos;s a serious matter because it can leave people traumatised. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br>Traumatised</strong>, it means, they end up with emotional wounds which affect them psychologically. Bullies want to intimidate people.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br>To intimidate</strong>, in other words, to make people fear them. Yes, it does make people feel they can&apos;t help themselves - they&apos;re powerless. They feel <strong>helpless</strong>.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Unfortunately, bullying has been increasing in the workplace in spite of laws against it. Let&apos;s go for some figures. Are you ready for a question, Neil? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, I am.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>The Workplace Bullying Institute based in the US conducted a survey last year. How much of the American workforce has experienced bullying at work? Was it: </span></p>
<p><span>a) 7%</span></p>
<p><span>b) 27%</span></p>
<p><span>c) 47%</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, I don&apos;t know but I&#x2019;m going to go for 27%.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>OK. I&apos;ll give you the answer by the end of the programme.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&apos;m very keen to know, Rob. Intimidating people is a bad thing but some might say that, well, aggression is part of human nature.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, that&apos;s an interesting point, Neil. I can imagine big strong men imposing their will by force in the Stone Age, but behaving this way now probably isn&apos;t a good idea. The California-based anthropologist Christopher Boehm explains. Listen and then tell me: what made bullying go out of fashion?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Christopher Boehm, Anthropologist at the University of California, US<br></span></strong><em><span>About a quarter of a million years ago, humans began to hunt zebras and antelope. And they had <strong>to cooperate</strong> to do so because their weapons were rather primitive and they did not want <strong>alpha males</strong> to be dominating the carcass after it was killed. So the thing that everyone else did was to start killing alpha males. Bullies simply were not tolerated.&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Ah, people had <strong>to cooperate</strong> with each other - in other words, to work together for their mutual benefit. They were hunting animals for food.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes, and nobody wanted the <strong>alpha male</strong> - the strong man in the group who wanted to dominate everybody else - to take all the meat for himself.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So about 250,000 years ago, when human society was evolving, people realised it wasn&apos;t good for the community to have a bully around. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong>No. So if we make a big jump in history and back to the 21st&#xA0;century, well, modern companies value cooperation. People&apos;s wellbeing matters too.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right. Many countries have laws against bullying which is part of the companies&apos; human resources policy. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span><strong>Human Resources</strong> - also known by the initials HR - is the department which hires new employees and stores information about their career at the company. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And what sort of behaviour is considered bullying in the civilised world?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s what Helene Guldberg is about to explain to us. She&apos;s a specialist in developmental psychology. What&apos;s the main thing that defines bullying?<br><br></span><strong><span>Helene Guldberg, developmental psychologist<br></span></strong><em><span>Something that is <strong>intentional</strong> on the part of the perpetrator; it has to involve some kind of power imbalance, so it&apos;s not an argument between equals, and it&apos;s something that is repetitive. So it&apos;s not a one off rage by one person against another. The intent is to cause harm, which can be psychological or physical. </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>To be considered bullying, the behaviour has to be <strong>intentional</strong>, which means it has to be planned or deliberate. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And also has to happen many times and involve power. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. One person has to have more power than the other.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You know, Rob, this idea of intention is very important, because some people are just more confident and demanding then others. They might say that they didn&apos;t mean to cause any harm. They don&apos;t mean to bully anyone.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes. But it can be interpreted differently. Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, studied bullying in the workplace. He uses a word which means the way someone interprets something they see or hear. Which word is it?<br><br></span><strong><span>Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, US<br></span></strong><em><span>At the end of the day, if the target feels as if they&apos;re being bullied, the corporation needs to make sure they&apos;re addressing that feeling. If you&apos;re the supervisor who&apos;s... your subordinate says that they&apos;re being bullied by you or abused by you, while you may not feel you&apos;re doing that, it&apos;s your responsibility as a communicator to make sure that they are getting the accurate <strong>perception</strong> of your behaviour. Being known as a bully is a stigma that nobody in a corporation wants.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It&apos;s <strong>perception</strong>. According to Darren Treadway, bullying is a matter of perception - the way some action is interpreted by a person, in this case, a subordinate. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>And supervisors have to be aware of how their subordinates see their behaviour. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>It&apos;s all a matter of communication. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. But we are running out of time, I&apos;m afraid. Let&apos;s go back to the question I put to you earlier in the programme. It&apos;s about a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute. I asked how much of the American workforce has experienced bullying in the workplace. The options were 7%, 27% and 47%.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And I guessed 27%.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>And you guessed very well. The answer is indeed 27%. What do you think about that?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, it&apos;s depressingly high, isn&apos;t it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes, it is. OK. Well, before we go, could you remind us of some of the words that we&apos;ve heard today, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. We&apos;ve heard: </span></p>
<p><span>traumatised</span></p>
<p><span>to intimidate</span></p>
<p><span>helpless</span></p>
<p><span>to cooperate</span></p>
<p><span>alpha male</span></p>
<p><span>human resources</span></p>
<p><span>intentional</span></p>
<p><span>perception</span></p>
