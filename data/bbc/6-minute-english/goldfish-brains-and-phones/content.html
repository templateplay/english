<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English &#x2013; the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Neil.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And I&apos;m Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. It&apos;s 6 Minute English!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we have a challenge for everyone &#x2013; can you stay focused for the full six minutes?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Sounds easy? Maybe not, because today we&apos;re talking about our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span>: are they shrinking?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right, so we&apos;re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something &#x2013; that&apos;s our <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> &#x2013; actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that &#x2013; in fact, it claims the human </span><strong><span>attention span</span></strong><span> is now shorter than that of a goldfish.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Can that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media &#x2013; these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) around 30 minutes,<br></span><span>b) around two and a half hours, or<br></span><span>c) over three hours?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I&apos;m going to say around two and a half hours - that&apos;s answer &apos;b&apos;.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it&apos;s fallen to just eight seconds.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>Right, and that&apos;s a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they&apos;re to blame for all these <strong>distractions</strong></span><span> &#x2013; now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier &#x2013; goldfish reportedly have an <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> of nine seconds. That&apos;s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And there&apos;s a phrase in English &#x2013; we say &apos;to have the <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> of a goldfish&apos;. Or &apos;the memory of a goldfish&apos;. So these poor&#x2026; poor gold goldfish, Neil.</span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, they get <strong>a bad press</strong>, don&apos;t they? That&apos;s a phrase which means &apos;criticism&apos; &#x2013; especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers &#x2013; or the &apos;press&apos;, as we call it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So &#x2013; is it really true than humans are now even more easily <strong>distracted</strong></span><span> than fish?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly &#x2013; they couldn&apos;t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn&apos;t find scientific evidence that our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> are in fact shrinking.</span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And secondly &#x2013; the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> in the first place. It&apos;s a term that&apos;s widely used, but it&apos;s not very scientific.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Sounds <strong>fishy</strong></span><span>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. <strong>Fishy</strong></span><span> means &#x2018;suspicious&apos;, by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So, are we humans in fact more easily <strong>distracted </strong></span><span>than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days.</span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open University<br></strong><span>It&apos;s all <strong>down to</strong></span><span> the individual; it&apos;s all </span><strong><span>down to</span></strong><span> how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone&apos;s </span><strong><span>distracted</span></strong><span> by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn&apos;t mean that they then don&apos;t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So she says we&apos;re not necessarily more easily <strong>distracted</strong></span><span>. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right. She&apos;s really saying we can <strong>multitask</strong></span><span> better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>She said: &quot;It&apos;s all <strong>down to</strong></span><span> how you choose to apply your attention.&quot; Let&apos;s just highlight that phrase </span><strong><span>down to</span></strong><span>. Here, it means &apos;depends on&apos;. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So &#x2013; maybe our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> aren&apos;t getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Which reminds me today&apos;s question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, my <strong>attention span</strong> is not that short that I can&apos;t remember that I said two and a half hours.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And the answer &#x2013; if you believe the research &#x2013; is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Thank you. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I try not to, what about you?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It&apos;s probably more than that to be honest. Now, I&apos;m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones &#x2013; or maybe they&apos;re even touching them now as they listen &#x2013; but either way, let&apos;s have a review of today&apos;s phrases.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK, so first we had <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> &#x2013; that&apos;s the length of time we can focus on something.</span><span>&#xA0; </span><span>And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be&#x2026; Neil? Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Sorry &#x2013; I just got <strong>distracted</strong></span><span> there by a message on my phone. Apologies.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s alright. So, next up we had <strong>a bad press</strong></span><span>. Goldfish get </span><strong><span>a bad press</span></strong><span>. Social media gets </span><strong><span>a bad press</span></strong><span>. And this means they all get criticism in the media.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>fishy</strong></span><span>. If something&apos;s fishy, it&apos;s suspicious. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>multitask</strong></span><span>. To </span><strong><span>multitask</span></strong><span> is to do several things at once. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Then we had <strong>down to</strong></span><span>. Here it means &apos;depends on&apos;, though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it&apos;s all </span><strong><span>down</span></strong><span> to the context!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And that&apos;s our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you <strong>distracted</strong></span><span>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>If you&apos;re looking for <strong>distractions</strong></span><span> &#x2013; may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Both<br></span></strong><span>Goodbye.</span></p></div>
