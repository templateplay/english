<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob...</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>...and I&apos;m Neil. Hello.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br></strong>Hello, Neil! You look pleased today, Neil. </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>I am pleased. I just moved into my new flat! &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, fantastic! Congratulations! Where is this new flat? </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>It&apos;s in the city. It&apos;s a one-bed flat so it&apos;s <strong>bijoux</strong> - meaning small but attractive. There&apos;s a balcony, I&apos;ve got a couple of deckchairs, and a barbecue...</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>I can&apos;t wait to see it. It sounds perfect. Well, today we&apos;re discussing housing - and why in some buildings there are separate entrances for rich and poor residents! So, are you ready for today&apos;s quiz question, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m all ears.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Rob<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">OK, so you mean you&apos;re listening carefully.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">I am.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Rob<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Right. What does &apos;social housing&apos; mean? Is it housing for people who...</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">a) want to buy or rent at a low price?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">b) want to live together sharing facilities?</span></p>
<p>or c) aren&apos;t able to pay any rent at all?</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">OK, I think the answer is a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, we&apos;ll see if you were right or wrong later on in the programme. So, have you met your neighbours yet, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes - I bumped into one couple as I was leaving for work this morning.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>I see.<strong> Bump into</strong> means to meet somebody by chance. So were they friendly?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, they complained about me blocking the communal area with my bike - also about my guitar playing. But apart from that, they seemed nice!</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>A <strong>communal area</strong> is an area that is shared by a number of people. Well, I hate to say it, Neil, but your guitar playing is annoying!</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, Rob, genius isn&apos;t appreciated here, I think. OK... Let&apos;s listen to the journalist Tom Bateman talking about rich and poor doors.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Tom Bateman, journalist<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">In front of us here is a 20-storey building. Right about me I got tinted blue glass windows and balconies on every floor as you look from the street. And there is a very plush foyer. A sign in the window says &apos;luxurious penthouses with spectacular views.&apos;</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>But this is what the journalist Tom Bateman saw when he went around the other side of the same building.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Tom Bateman, journalist<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">So as you come down the side of the building, you can see the windows - quite small windows - of the flats above here - certainly no balconies. This is a big grey concrete wall and as you walk down an alleyway towards the other door.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So this building has one entrance with a <strong>plush</strong> - or expensive and luxurious - foyer. And <strong>foyer</strong> means entrance hall. Then there&apos;s another entrance down an <strong>alleyway</strong> - or narrow passage between buildings.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">This entrance leads to flats with small windows and no balconies. Why&apos;s that, Rob? </span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s because the alleyway entrance is the so-called &apos;poor door&apos;. There&apos; no swanky foyer or tinted glass windows for these residents because they pay less rent than the people living in the apartments at the front.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Swanky</strong> means something fashionable and expensive that is designed to impress people. And <strong>tinted</strong> glass is coloured glass - so people can&apos;t look through your windows.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Rob<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">That sounds useful! Do you have tinted glass windows, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">No, I don&apos;t. Tinted sunglasses are all that I can afford. So what do people think about having a rich door and a poor door for the same building, Rob? </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">Well, some people think it&apos;s terrible. They say it&apos;s <strong>segregation</strong> - or separation and different treatment of people - and I can&apos;t believe the poor-door people put up with it really!</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>To</strong> <strong>put up with something</strong> means to accept something that is annoying without complaining about it. The thing is, though, the poor-door people don&apos;t pay nearly as much rent. And they don&apos;t have to pay the same service charges that the rich-door people pay.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">A <strong>service charge </strong>is an amount of money you pay to the owner of an apartment building for things like putting out the rubbish. Well, let&apos;s listen to an experience of a poor-door resident. </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Abdul Mohammed, resident of One Commercial St, City of London<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">We can&apos;t use the lift... because it&apos;s for the rich people. So whenever the doors open, I use it. So they try and tell me off for using it. I say, &apos;here, come, take me to court - I don&apos;t mind&apos;. </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">So what has Abdul been doing that the rich-door residents don&apos;t like, Rob?</span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, he&apos;s been using their lift because it&apos;s near his apartment door.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And what does Abdul mean when he says, &apos;come, take me to court&apos;?</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Rob<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">He&apos;s inviting the rich-door residents to take legal action against him, but Abdul doesn&apos;t really think he&apos;s doing anything wrong. </span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, it&apos;s time to hear the answer to today&apos;s quiz question.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. What does &apos;social housing&apos; mean? Is it flats or houses for people... a) who want to buy or rent at a low price? b) who want to live together sharing facilities? or c) who aren&apos;t able to pay any rent at all?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you were right! So well done for that, Neil. Now, shall we listen to the words we&apos;ve learned on today&apos;s programme?</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Good idea. We heard:<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">bijoux<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">bump into<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">communal area<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">plush<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">foyer<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">alleyway<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">swanky<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">tinted<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">segregation<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">to put up with something<br></span><span data-mce-mark="1">service charge</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Rob<br></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Thank you. Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;</span>s 6 Minute English. I hope you felt at home with us on today&apos;s show! Please join us again soon.</p>
