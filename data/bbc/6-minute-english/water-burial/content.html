<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English &#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Neil. In this episode we&apos;ll be discussing water burial.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> Yes. It&#x2019;s a bit of a <strong>bleak</strong> subject, I&#x2019;m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&#xA0;<br> Something which is <strong>bleak</strong> is unpleasant or without hope.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> And, do you know what&#x2019;s really <strong>bleak</strong>? It&#x2019;s this week&apos;s question. On average, how many people die each hour?</p>
<p>a) six thousand</p>
<p>b) sixty thousand</p>
<p>c) six hundred thousand</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>I am going to guess b) sixty thousand</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>And we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 55m people each year. Now, religious or not, there is a practical issue to be dealt with, which is, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>What to do with the body?<br> <br><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Exactly! So what are the options for the average person?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> Well, there&#x2019;s burial, or there&#x2019;s cremation.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Burial is when a body is put into the earth and cremation is when a body is burnt. But there are big problems with both. For example, what two things do most people need in order to be buried?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Well, a coffin &#x2013; or a box to put the body in and a <strong>grave</strong>. That&#x2019;s the place the coffin and body go into.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Exactly, but coffins are most often made of wood. In the US they use four million acres of forest every year just to make coffins. And as for <strong>graves</strong>, cemeteries are beginning to get overcrowded &#x2013; there&#x2019;s no space left! After all, dying is not exactly a new thing! It&#x2019;s been happening for years.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> Aha, but with <strong>cremation,</strong> there&#x2019;s no space needed. And they burn gas to dispose of the body. That&#x2019;s got to be better.<br> <br> <strong>Dan</strong><br> You&#x2019;d think so, but no. I&#x2019;ll let Sahar Zand, reporter for the BBC, explain why.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT <br> Sahar Zand, BBC reporter<br> </strong>During the process, a number of <strong>toxins</strong> can be emitted into our environment, including mercury from dental fillings. Cremation also has a carbon cost. With the energy used to process one body, you could actually heat a home for the best part of a week in winter</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> So cremation can release <strong>toxins</strong>, or poisons, into the environment and it comes with a very high energy cost &#x2013; enough to heat a home for almost a week! OK. I can see a smug look in your eye, Dan. What do you have up your sleeve?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>It&#x2019;s the latest thing. Water burial.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Water burial?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>This is where the body is put into an alkali solution and heated to 150 degrees centigrade. This breaks down the tissue and leaves only the skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Yes! It has huge advantages over cremation</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Such as?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Well for one thing, it takes only 4 hours to finish. It follows the same process as when a body <strong>decomposes</strong>, but quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>When something <strong>decomposes</strong> it breaks down and decays. Ok, anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>It uses much less energy. Each body is weighed and then the computer calculates exactly how much of everything is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Ok, it&#x2019;s more efficient too. Why are you smiling?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>This is the best part! Listen to Sahar again.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Sahar Zand, BBC reporter</strong><br> All that&#x2019;s left at this point is a <strong>brittle</strong> skeleton and any artificial <strong>implants</strong> that they may have had in their body &#x2013; and they come out almost as good as new. There&#x2019;s even talk of sending the implants to the developing world, where they can benefit populations that don&#x2019;t have access to them, because they&#x2019;re very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>So after the process you have a <strong>brittle, </strong>or easy to break, skeleton and any <strong>implants</strong> that they had inside them.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> Implants </strong>are artificial additions to the body, such as plastic hips or an artificial heart. And they&#x2019;re clean! They can be recycled and given to someone who needs them! Isn&#x2019;t that cool?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>So, what happens to the skeleton?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>It gets ground up into dust and put in a jar to give to the family &#x2013; exactly the same as a traditional cremation. I love it! Sign me up! Would you like to give it a shot?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Well, I can&#x2019;t answer that question. But can I have the answer to our quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Of course. I asked: On average, how many people die each hour?</p>
<p>a) six thousand</p>
<p>b) sixty thousand</p>
<p>c) six hundred thousand</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>I said b) sixty thousand</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>And you, my friend, are dead in the water. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s a) six thousand</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Ok. Well that&#x2019;s probably better, isn&#x2019;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Yes.<br> <br> <strong>Neil</strong><br> Shall we have a look at the vocabulary then?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Certainly. Our first word was <strong>bleak</strong> meaning something unhappy, unpleasant or without hope. What types of things do we typically describe as bleak, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Oh, the weather in the UK can be bleak. It&#x2019;s very, very dark in the winter. Next we had <strong>grave</strong>. A grave is a hole in the earth where a body is placed. However, there is another use.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Yes. We can talk about a situation being <strong>grave</strong>. The outbreak of war is a very grave situation for many people. Then we had <strong>toxin</strong>. A <strong>toxin</strong> is a substance which is poisonous. Have you ever been poisoned by a toxin, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Well, I suppose so, yes. I&#x2019;ve had food poisoning and that&#x2019;s caused by <strong>toxins</strong>. &#xA0;After that was <strong>decompose</strong>. When something <strong>decomposes</strong>, it breaks down and decays. Much like when fruit goes bad and turns black and then becomes liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Then we had <strong>brittle</strong>. Something which is <strong>brittle</strong> is easily broken. For example, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Glass, crockery, tiles and some plastic. Crisps! And finally we had <strong>implant</strong>. An <strong>implant</strong> is something artificial which has been put into the body &#x2013; such as an artificial heart or a replacement hip. Would you like to have any implants, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>I&#x2019;d quite like robotic legs. Then I could run faster than anyone!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Well, we&#x2019;ve run out of time, so that&#x2019;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!</p></div>
