<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English &#x2013; the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I&apos;m Catherine. Today we&apos;re taking a look into the lives of the super rich &#x2013; and we&apos;re going to look at one of their favourite pastimes.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>The super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of <strong>assets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Assets</strong> are things we can own and sell &#x2013; like property, boats and private planes.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Expensive toys. First things first, let&apos;s do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; China</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Brazil</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Vietnam?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I&apos;m going to go for Vietnam. I think, that&apos;s an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ok, well we&apos;ll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, this doesn&apos;t mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world&apos;s richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, my question is &#x2013; what on earth do people with so much money spend it on?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>One academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is &#x2026;, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yachts! A yacht &#x2013; a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate <strong>status symbol</strong> &#x2013; that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let&apos;s listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What&apos;s so unusual about yachts?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff University<br></strong>If you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet &#x2013; these are investable <strong>assets</strong> &#x2013; something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs &#x2013; and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they <strong>make</strong> good, sound <strong>business sense</strong>. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a <strong>black hole</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Before we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain <strong>assets</strong> like planes and wine that <strong>made business sense</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, to make sense &#x2013; is a phrase you&apos;ll be familiar with. So, if we say something <strong>makes business sense</strong>, it means &apos;it&apos;s good for business&apos;. But yachts are different.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a <strong>black hole</strong> of wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>A <strong>black hole</strong>, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape &#x2013; not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It&apos;s also used conversationally to mean &apos;a place where things go missing&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>These superyachts are big. The world&apos;s longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study &#x2013; she used to work on the yachts.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>She&apos;s now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, what else did she learn?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>She says that in the world of the super rich &#x2013; the size of your yacht shows your place in <strong>the pecking order</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The <strong>pecking order</strong> means &apos;the social system from most powerful to least powerful&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>If you&apos;re higher up in the yachting <strong>pecking order</strong>, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Apparently, so. It&apos;s all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>. Now that&apos;s another great term &#x2013; conspicuous means &apos;visible or noticeable&apos; and consumption means &apos;spending&apos;. So, the phrase <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong> refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Before we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today&apos;s question.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam &#x2013; according to the same report by Knight Frank &#x2013; the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Very good. We started with <strong>assets</strong> &#x2013; here it means &apos;things we can buy or sell&apos;. What are your assets?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I&apos;m not like you though Neil, I don&apos;t live in an expensive mansion &#x2013; that would be a real <strong>status symbol</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>If only that were true, but it&apos;s a good example. A <strong>status symbol</strong> is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and we had the phrase to <strong>make business sense</strong> &#x2013; in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Or I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they&apos;re a <strong>black hole</strong> for our money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, did you know our next phrase, <strong>pecking order</strong>, actually comes from chicken behaviour?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And finally, the phrase <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And to clear up two similar phrases: a <strong>status symbol</strong> refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong> refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you&apos;re spending money so that other people notice.</p>
