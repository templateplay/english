<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil. In this programme we&apos;ll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course<em>. </em>&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Can we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I&apos;ve got to <strong>shoot off</strong> to a party later.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Shoot off</strong> meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it&apos;s funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Is that so? I have a question about that for you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Fire away</strong> then.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>Fire away</strong>, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m going to guess b) Iceland, just because I&apos;ve never been there.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It&apos;s got to be a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, in most countries in the world you&apos;d be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon &#x2013; which is a kind of blanket &#x2013; and they wrap them up and <strong>restrain </strong>them, or prevent them from moving.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>You&apos;re pulling my leg.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Nope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation:&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br> <strong>Anthony Berteaux, Japanese Journalist<br></strong>What most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it&apos;s always to <strong>de-escalate</strong> it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, they safely <strong>restrain</strong> the person and wait for the situation to <strong>de-escalate</strong>, or become less intense.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Unless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Surely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>You&apos;d think so, but no. It seems that guns don&apos;t really feature in crimes much in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s astonishing. So do you think the criminals don&apos;t carry guns because the police don&apos;t carry guns or that the police don&apos;t carry guns because the criminals don&apos;t carry guns?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Wow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don&apos;t know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence&#xA0;<br></strong>The American model has been &apos;<strong>militarise</strong> the police&apos;, but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society.And I&apos;m very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature <strong>arms race</strong> between police and criminals.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, America tends to <strong>militarise</strong> its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>&#x2026;and that causes an <strong>arms race</strong> with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>He also said that there&apos;s not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it&apos;s a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m sorry Neil, that&apos;s not right. But, don&apos;t shoot the messenger, OK? It&apos;s Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>How interesting. Now, let&apos;s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Sure, we had <strong>shoot off</strong>. If you <strong>shoot off</strong>, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>It&apos;s a phrasal verb so it&apos;s used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, <strong>he shot off to the hospital</strong>. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had <strong>fire away. </strong>Now,<strong> fire away</strong> is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> I&apos;d say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. <strong>Restrain. </strong>If you <strong>restrain</strong> someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might <strong>restrain</strong> yourself from doing something &#x2013; for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to <strong>restrain</strong> your children from anything, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I have to <strong>restrain</strong> my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and <strong>restrain</strong> them. OK, <strong>de-escalate </strong>&#x2013;If something <strong>de-escalates</strong>, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises <strong>escalated</strong> over a period of two weeks and <strong>de-escalated</strong> only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! <strong>Militarise. </strong>If something is <strong>militarised</strong>, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become <strong>militarised</strong>, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Yes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service &#x2013; that&apos;s join the army for a couple of years &#x2013; so they became <strong>militarised</strong>. Now, an <strong>arms race.&#xA0; </strong>An <strong>arms race</strong> is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan?<br> <strong><br> Dan<br> </strong>The most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an <strong>arms race</strong> to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English.
