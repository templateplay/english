<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I&apos;m Dan. Today we&apos;re talking about one of the last mysteries of science. No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home &#x2013; but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We&apos;ll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that &#x2013; I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you <strong>a cat person</strong> or <strong>a dog person</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, that&apos;s easy &#x2013; I&apos;m <strong>a cat person</strong>, for sure. Dogs are just a&#x2026; well, they are hard work, aren&apos;t they?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>If you say you are &apos;<strong>a cat person</strong>&apos; it means you prefer cats. &apos;<strong>A coffee person</strong>&apos; prefers coffee. A &apos;something&apos; person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Back to the topic, I&apos;m <strong>a cat person</strong>. But can you answer this, Dan? Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world&apos;s longest cat. How long is Omar? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) 120 cm</p>
<p>b) 80 cm</p>
<p>Or c) 180 cm</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&apos;m gonna say c) 180 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, from long cats to long-distance cats. Scientists were <strong>scratching their heads</strong> a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home. How did it do it?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We say you &apos;<strong>scratch your head</strong>&apos; when you are confused about something. There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate &#x2013; but we don&apos;t yet have the full answer.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts &#x2013; they let you know where you are. Visual <strong>landmarks</strong> also play a role, just as they do with humans. A <strong>landmark</strong> is something very easily recognised &#x2013; a big building or mountain for example.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And what about this one: <strong>magnets</strong> are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a <strong>magnetic</strong> force.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles &#x2013; it tells them where north is. It&apos;s thought they have some iron in their beaks.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So we have a few ideas &#x2013; smell, <strong>landmarks</strong>, <strong>magnetic</strong> forces &#x2013; but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Let&apos;s hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol<br></strong>What they do when they are in a new <strong>territory</strong> is explore it in a very <strong>systematic</strong> way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they&apos;ll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that&apos;s lost its territory probably does the same thing. They&apos;ll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they&apos;ll either come across the <strong>territory</strong> or they&apos;ll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Cats have a <strong>systematic</strong> approach &#x2013; which means they use a <strong>system</strong>. Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one &#x2013; until they have a strong mental map of the place.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes &#x2013; a mental map is a map in your head &#x2013; stored in your memory. And the area cats explore &#x2013; their home area - is called their <strong>territory</strong>. Cats are <strong>territorial</strong> &#x2013; which means their <strong>territory</strong> is very important to them.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue &#x2013; which is a <strong>landmark</strong> or a smell &#x2013; that tells it where it is. Well, that&apos;s the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don&apos;t have enough data &#x2013; that&apos;s enough information about this.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>When there is a scientific breakthrough - we&apos;ll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope. For now, let&apos;s content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world&apos;s longest cat. How long, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I said 180 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Omar measures 120 cm &#x2013; that&apos;s over two thirds of my height &#x2013; and weighs a heavy 14 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he&apos;d be found in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>He&apos;s a <strong>landmark</strong> in himself! Which reminds me &#x2013; let&apos;s run through today&apos;s words again. If you&apos;re <strong>a cat person</strong>, you prefer cats. If you&apos;re <strong>an evening person</strong> &#x2013; you prefer evenings.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&apos;ve always thought you were a kind person, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Indeed. We don&apos;t want the listeners to be <strong>scratching their heads</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, we can&apos;t confuse them! So let&apos;s explain the next one clearly &#x2013; a <strong>landmark</strong> is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are. The bridges in London are <strong>landmarks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And can we say the parks are <strong>magnets</strong> in summer? A <strong>magnet </strong>is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel &#x2013; but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: <strong>territory</strong> is a noun &#x2013; the area of land that an animal considers to be its own.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Animals who feel this strongly are described as <strong>territorial</strong>. Humans can be too &#x2013; about land or subjects they feel they own or control.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And finally <strong>systematic</strong>: the adjective from system. We can talk about a <strong>systematic</strong> approach, a <strong>systematic</strong> solution, a <strong>systematic</strong> study&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And we have <strong>systematically</strong> worked our way through all of today&apos;s words!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Very good! Which means &#x2013; it&apos;s time mention our own online <strong>territory</strong> &#x2013; our website and social media pages.</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Bye bye for now.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Goodbye!</p></div>
