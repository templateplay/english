<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&#x2019;m Neil. In this episode we&#x2019;ll be discussing food waste, just as soon as&#x2026;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> Neil, did you just throw the rest of that apple away?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah. It was quite a big one and I couldn&#x2019;t finish it.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> Neil, you know you shouldn&#x2019;t <strong>waste</strong> food.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> Waste</strong> meaning to throw away without consuming or using.&#xA0; Ah, it&#x2019;s only an apple. It&#x2019;s not the end of the world, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, that&#x2019;s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week&#x2019;s question. How much of the world&#x2019;s food is wasted each year?</p>
<p>a) a half</p>
<p>b) a third</p>
<p>c) a quarter</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> I&#x2019;m not sure. I know it&#x2019;s a lot so I&#x2019;m going to say a) a half</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll find out if you&#x2019;re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food, which is enough to feed a billion hungry people. Where do you think all this food waste comes from?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> Well, restaurants, I imagine. I mean, they can&#x2019;t give one customer&#x2019;s <strong>leftovers </strong>to another! That would be unhygienic!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>Leftovers </strong>are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Supermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Think closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It&#x2019;s us, isn&#x2019;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can&#x2019;t guess what we do with it?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it&#x2019;s not.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>No. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A <strong>landfill </strong>is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Exactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&#x2019;s impressive, how did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>They attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&#x2019;ve heard about her. She became a <strong>household name</strong> in Denmark overnight!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>A household name</strong> is one which everybody knows, and that&#x2019;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I thought she was Russian?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>She is. But, I&#x2019;ll let her explain.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Selina Juul<br></strong>I come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this <strong>abundance</strong>, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn&#x2019;t enough food because of the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>, meaning the basic systems and services of a society &#x2013; such as food transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Then when she moved to Denmark, she found an <strong>abundance</strong>, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So she decided to do something about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called &#x2018;stop wasting food&#x2019; and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>How did she do it?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She&#x2019;s produced a <strong>leftovers</strong> cookbook and she&#x2019;s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Wow, she&#x2019;s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week&#x2019;s question.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Sure! I asked you how much of the world&#x2019;s food is wasted each year?</p>
<p>a) a half</p>
<p>b) a third</p>
<p>c) a quarter<br> <strong><br> Neil<br> </strong>And I said a) a half</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I&#x2019;m terribly sorry, mate, but you&#x2019;re wrong. The answer is b) a third.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, it&#x2019;s not as bad as I thought it was, at least.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Shall we look at the vocabulary then?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, let&#x2019;s. First we had <strong>waste</strong>. If you <strong>waste</strong> something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we <strong>waste</strong> are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with <strong>waste </strong>too. Can you think of one, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A <strong>waste of space</strong> is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I&#x2019;m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can&#x2019;t cook at all. Next we had <strong>leftovers. Leftovers</strong> are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your <strong>leftovers</strong>, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh I love <strong>leftovers</strong>! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>I agree! Pizza&#x2019;s a great example!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Then we had <strong>landfill</strong>. A <strong>landfill</strong> is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a <strong>dump</strong>. Do you ever take your rubbish to the <strong>dump</strong>, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Not if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the <strong>dump </strong>if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had <strong>a household name</strong>. To be <strong>a household name</strong> is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is <strong>a household name</strong> at the moment, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, that&#x2019;s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had <strong>infrastructure</strong>. <strong>Infrastructure</strong> is the basic systems and services of a society &#x2013; such as electricity supply, trains, and roads.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And finally we had <strong>abundance</strong>. If you have an <strong>abundance</strong> of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in <strong>abundance</strong>, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, when it comes to my children I have to have an <strong>abundance</strong> of patience&#x2026;.well, most of the time. And, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
