<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>&#x2026; and I&apos;m Neil. Hello.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hi there, Neil! Now, Neil... what&apos;s that on your face? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>What&#x2026; this? It&apos;s a beard, Rob. Have you never seen one before?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>I have. But I&apos;ve never seen one on you before&#x2026; and I&apos;m surprised to say, it looks good on you! &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, thank you! I thought I&apos;d get on the beard bandwagon, you know. Beards are <strong>all the rage</strong> at the moment - that means &apos;very fashionable&apos;. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>And <strong>to get on a bandwagon</strong> is when you join other people in doing something that has become popular &#x2013; perhaps because you hope to become popular yourself! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that doesn&apos;t apply to me, Rob, because, as you know, I&apos;m very popular already.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Yes, I know that, of course... Anyway, beards are such <strong>a talking point</strong> &#x2013; a subject that a lot of people are discussing &#x2013; that we decided to talk about them on today&apos;s programme! So are you ready for today&apos;s question, Neil? What&apos;s the name for someone who loves beards? Is it&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span>a) barbophile?</span></p>
<p><span>b) pogonophile?</span></p>
<p><span>or c) pelophile?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm. All the answers sound tempting. But I&#x2019;m going to go for a) barbophile.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Right. OK, well we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right or wrong later on. But this is interesting: a new scientific study suggests that the more beards there are in a population, the less attractive they become &#x2013; and this currently gives clean-shaven men a competitive advantage. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong></span><span>Oh, no! That&apos;s bad news for me, then! <strong>Competitive advantage</strong> means when a condition or circumstance puts you in a favourable position &#x2013; in this case, being <strong>clean-shaven</strong> or having no facial hair. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s right. We&#x2019;ve reached &apos;peak beard&apos; apparently. Beard popularity has <strong>peaked</strong> &#x2013; or reached its highest point &#x2013; and will decline in popularity from this point. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. Let&apos;s listen to writer, Lucinda Hawksley, talking about beards through history. And listen out for a word that means women&apos;s struggle to achieve the same rights and opportunities as men.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Lucinda Hawksley, writer of Moustaches, Whiskers and Beards<br></span></strong><span>It&apos;s interesting, while I was writing the book I came to realize that the most heavily bearded times in Britain are either when women are in power, such as Elizabeth I or Queen Victoria, or when there&apos;s a big discussion of feminism - and it is really interesting that in the last few years there&apos;s been so much more discussion of feminism. You get a woman on the throne and men go, &apos;Oh, got to have a beard.&apos; It&apos;s really strange. Or in the 60s or 70s with all the kind of, you know, big thing about women&apos;s lib, suddenly the beard becomes huge here.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>Well, needless to say Lucinda doesn&apos;t have a beard, but she certainly knows a lot about them. She&apos;s the great great granddaughter of famous writer Charles Dickens, who <strong>sported</strong> &#x2013; or wore &#x2013; a very flamboyant beard. <strong>Flamboyant</strong> means eye-catching and different. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, did you spot the word for women&apos;s struggle to achieve the same rights as men? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. It&apos;s <strong>feminism</strong>. She also talks about <strong>women&apos;s lib</strong>, which is short for women&apos;s liberation. And this has a similar meaning to feminism. So, what do you think, Neil? Are beards a show of testosterone in reaction to powerful women? Is that why you&apos;ve grown your beard?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s <strong>testosterone</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s the main male hormone. For me, it&apos;s laziness. I&apos;m flying the flag for men&apos;s lib &#x2013; liberation from the razor.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Right. Well, I&apos;m not sure whether that&apos;s a worthy cause or not, Neil. Let&apos;s hear from Brock Elbank, the photographer behind the exhibition &apos;Beard&apos;. He&#x2019;s talking about one of the people he photographed.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Brock Elbank, photographer<br></strong>I found Jimmy on a friend&apos;s Facebook page whilst I was in Sydney. Invited him to come to my home studio for a portrait and I posted it and it got reblogged over half a million times in four hours. I mean I think when Jimmy and I&#x2026; when I met Jimmy he told me about his &apos;beard season&apos; melanoma charity and I was kind of on board from the get go.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>So Jimmy must have a pretty awesome beard! &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Indeed. We should check out the Beard exhibition and find out. But Jimmy has a beard for a special reason, right Neil?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s right. Yes. Brock mentions Jimmy&apos;s melanoma charity. <strong>Melanoma</strong> is a serious type of skin cancer and Jimmy is raising money and awareness to help people who suffer from it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>And Brock says he was <strong>on</strong> <strong>board from the get go</strong> &#x2013; meaning he wanted to be involved with the charity right from the start.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>We should also mention &apos;Movember&apos; and &apos;Decembeard&apos; &#x2013; both campaigns invite men to get hairy for good causes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s right, good causes &#x2013; moustaches in November and beards in December. Now, let&apos;s have the answer to the quiz question. I asked: what&apos;s the name for someone who loves beards. Was it: a) barbophile b) pogonopile or c) pelophile? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) barbophile. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Wrong, I&apos;m afraid. The answer is actually b) pogonophile.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Oh, well, you can&apos;t win them all. Now then, Rob, can we hear today&apos;s words again?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Sure. We heard:</span></p>

<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><span>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. We hope it wasn&apos;t too hair-raising for you. Please join us again soon.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.</span></p></div>
