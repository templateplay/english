<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Hello, I&apos;m Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Finn. Hello, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>Hi Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>In this programme we&apos;re going to be talking about food banks in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, food banks. But what exactly are they?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Well, you can find them all over the country nowadays. They&apos;re part of a system where people who are struggling financially are given free food to cook or eat which other people have donated &#x2013; or given for free.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> We mean that people in modern-day Britain are so hard-up &#x2013; that means they&apos;ve got so little money &#x2013; that they can&apos;t afford to buy their own food? It does seem extraordinary, doesn&apos;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Yeah, it does. Well, today&apos;s question is about the people who use the food banks. So Finn, do you know how many British people are estimated to have used them? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) 15,000?</p>
<p>b) 240,000?</p>
<p>or c) 500,000?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> I&apos;ll say 240,000, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Well, we&apos;ll see if you&apos;re right at the end of the programme. Let&apos;s talk now about why food banks have opened up in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Yes, well, I suppose one place to start is the financial crisis of 2008 which <strong>made a lot of people</strong> <strong>redundant </strong>&#x2013; that means they were asked to leave their jobs by their companies &#x2013; so they became unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Then there were the cuts to the welfare system in 2013 which added to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Rising food prices themselves are another reason. And heating bills in the winter can be expensive. People fall into debt. You know, lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> And remember that it&apos;s not just unemployment, Finn, but underemployment, too. There are some people on what is called <strong>zero-hours contracts</strong> and doing part-time work and they don&apos;t earn enough money to buy some of the essential things in life.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>So there really are a lot of different factors, aren&apos;t there.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Well, let&apos;s listen to Steph Hagen as she explains how her food bank in Nottingham works. She uses an expression that means &apos;unlimited access&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Steph Hagen</strong><br>People do not go to a food bank because it&apos;s an <strong>open door</strong>, it&apos;s an open shop. It&apos;s a case of they go to it because they need to. And also with our food bank &#x2013; we are an independent one, and we have <strong>limited stocks</strong> &#x2013; so everybody who comes through our door has no income whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>She said &quot;open door&quot;. This means unlimited access.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And she said she had &quot;limited stocks&quot;. This means &apos;a shortage of goods&apos; &#x2013; there&apos;s not enough food for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>But Rob, surely this food bank system is open to abuse as well? What&apos;s to stop anyone just turning up and asking for food?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Well, there are checks in place and there&apos;s a system of <strong>referrals</strong>. If a doctor or a social worker thinks someone needs to use a food bank &#x2013; even for a short time &#x2013; they can give them vouchers. Then they take the vouchers along to the food bank and they get <strong>handouts</strong> for three days.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Right. So, I see. I&apos;ve heard that everything in food banks is donated &#x2013; that means it&apos;s given for free. And churches and individual donors are the people who provide most of it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Well, apparently, these food banks are a great meeting place for people who are lonely and depressed. The food bank volunteers then talk to the people who use them.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Some of these food banks also run courses about how to cook well on a low budget. So it&apos;s really not just handouts that these people get. It&apos;s information as well.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> But because these people are poor they often can&apos;t afford to use gas or electricity for cooking. So the food banks make sure they also provide food which can be eaten cold.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> That&apos;s right. And I think it would be wrong to assume that the users are just <strong>scroungers </strong>&#x2013; now that means people who want something for nothing &#x2013; because there&apos;s a loss of <strong>dignity</strong> and even shame attached to using these services and people would of course prefer not to have to do it. So, what food do they give out, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Well, let&apos;s listen to Steph again and see what she says. She uses an expression to describe canned food that only needs to be heated.</p>
<p><strong>Steph Hagen<br> </strong>Basically, we&apos;ve got porridge. We do occasionally get fresh produce but it&apos;s very rare, especially in the winter months. It&apos;s a case of, it&apos;s like, tinned fruit, <strong>tinned ready meals</strong>. What also <strong>goes into the mix</strong>, people don&apos;t realise we have to give out &apos;no-cooking&apos; food parcels because people can&apos;t afford the gas and electric...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>She said &quot;tinned ready meals&quot;. This is canned food that only needs to be heated.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And she said &quot;goes into the mix&quot;. This means it&apos;s &apos;part of the overall package&apos;. She also made the point about the importance of giving out &apos;no-cooking&apos; food parcels because some people don&apos;t have the electricity or the gas to cook the food. OK, Finn. So, would you like the answer to the quiz question now?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>Yes, please, yes. You asked me how many British people are estimated to have used food banks. Was it: 15,000, 240,000 or 500,000? And I guessed 240,000.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Well, sorry, Finn. I&apos;m afraid the answer is actually 500,000. And some experts say that there are 13 million people living below the poverty line in the UK right now.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>It really does show how food banks &#x2013; even in a country like ours &#x2013; are really needed. It does make you think, doesn&apos;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> It does. Well, we&apos;re almost out of time now. So, let&apos;s remind ourselves of some of the words we&apos;ve said today, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>OK.</p>
<p>make people redundant</p>
<p>zero-hours contracts</p>
<p>open door</p>
<p>referrals</p>
<p>handouts</p>
<p>limited stocks</p>
<p>scroungers</p>
<p>dignity</p>
<p>ready meals</p>
<p>goes into the mix</p>
