<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>&#x2026;and I&apos;m Finn. Hello, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hi there, Finn. I have to say you&apos;ve got a lean and hungry look today!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh really? I&apos;ll take that as a compliment, shall I?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Please do. Do you want a doughnut?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Actually, yeah &#x2013; can I have two? So what are we talking about today, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>We&apos;re talking about <strong>skinny</strong> &#x2013; or very thin &#x2013; models and whether there should be a law banning them from working on the catwalk. And a <strong>catwalk</strong> is the long runway that models walk down at fashion shows.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, no danger there for me there Rob &#x2013; I think I like eating a little bit too much.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And there&apos;s no danger of you becoming a model anyway, Finn &#x2013; because you&apos;re not good looking enough, I&apos;m afraid!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh really. OK. Thank you, Rob. That&apos;s very nice of you. I think it&apos;s time for today&apos;s quiz question, please.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK &#x2013; well, here goes. Which country banned the use of underweight models in 2013? Was it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) Israel</p>
<p>b) Canada</p>
<p>or c) the US</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>You know what? I&apos;ve got no idea. So I&apos;ll take a guess and say a) Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, we&apos;ll find out if that&apos;s the right answer later on. So come on, Finn, what do you think? Are the models we see on the catwalk and in the media too skinny?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, yeah, I think some models do look fantastic but others look painfully thin. Now, the <strong>media</strong>, by the way, refers to the different ways information is communicated to us, so, for example, through TV, radio, magazines, and often the internet and newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well let&apos;s listen to Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress, talking about a new French law being discussed, preventing the use of underweight models. Can you spot a phrase that means a limit or an ending?</p>
<p><strong>Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress<br></strong>I think it&apos;s a BMI of 18 or less, that&apos;s hopefully going to be banned by the French Assembly today. This is what the US health organization states as being kind of clinically unhealthy. So it&apos;s almost like a cut-off point. Yes, be thin, yes be thinner than the general population, but once it starts getting to unhealthy territory really that&apos;s time to start banning it.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And the French Assembly did pass this law a few days later. Now, did you spot the phrase for a limit or an ending? It&apos;s <strong>cut-off point</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So models that are too thin will be<strong> banned</strong> &#x2013; or won&apos;t be allowed &#x2013; to work. And the cut-off point is a BMI of 18 or less.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now<strong> BMI</strong> stands for body mass index. And this is the ratio of a person&apos;s height to their weight. <strong>Ratio</strong> means the relationship between two things, showing how big one thing is compared to another.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>But what happens if you&apos;re just naturally really thin? The authorities could be accused of <strong>discrimination</strong> against skinny people &#x2013; or treating some people less fairly than others.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That&apos;s right. It&apos;s a good point. And that&apos;s why the French authorities and those of some other countries are using BMI as a way of deciding. So, models with a BMI of 18 or less weigh too little when compared to how tall they are.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And <strong>clinically</strong> unhealthy &#x2013; what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It means when you need medical treatment for a condition or illness.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Now <strong>anorexia</strong> is an illness where a person refuses to eat in order to lose weight. But some models these days are so skinny they do look anorexic.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>You&apos;re right. Let&apos;s hear more from Jamie Gavin talking about protecting the health of models. What phrase is used to mean &apos;the responsibility&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress<br></strong>The theatrical agents and the modelling agents that have got a responsibility to look after their clients. There&apos;s a huge amount of pressure on both the agent and on the models themselves and really the buck lies with them to make sure these people are healthy and that they&apos;re looking after their careers as well.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So the problem with the modelling industry is that the agents who employ the girls <strong>put pressure on</strong> &#x2013; or strongly persuade &#x2013; them to lose weight.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And in this way they aren&apos;t taking care of their clients, they are actually putting them at risk. Now, why&apos;s that, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It&apos;s because many people in the fashion industry prefer very thin models so it&apos;s a case of <strong>supply and demand</strong>. The agents are simply supplying the fashion industry with the type of girls they want.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. And what does the reporter mean when he says the buck lies with the agents?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>When <strong>the</strong> <strong>buck lies &#x2013; or stops &#x2013; with someone</strong> it means it&apos;s his or her responsibility, not someone else&apos;s. And agents who employed underweight models can face fines of up to 75,000 euros, or even prison sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, shall we hear the answer to today&apos;s quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, I asked you which country banned the use of underweight models in 2013? Was it&#x2026; a) Israel b) Canada or c) the US?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I said a) Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you were right, Finn! Well done. Now, shall we listen to the words we learned today?</p>
