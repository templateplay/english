<p>The idea of delivering information via the internet to every person on the planet is has become a major priority for some of the biggest tech firms.</p>
<p>One idea is the Outernet. Neil and Catherine discuss this new system that aims to provide a library of knowledge for poor and remote communities &#x2013; beamed down to Earth via satellite. They also explain some related vocabulary.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>...and I&apos;m Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Hello, Catherine! Now, how was your holiday?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>My holiday was lovely, Neil. I was staying on a beautiful island. It was very remote and there was actually no internet access. So, I did feel quite cut off actually.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And <strong>cut off</strong> means isolated. How did you survive, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Well, it wasn&#x2019;t easy. But I had my <strong>e-reader</strong> - that&apos;s an electronic device which lets you store and read lots of books from the internet. And I read a lot of Harry Potter...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Harry Potter? I know you like wizards, Catherine, but shouldn&apos;t you have downloaded some classic literature? How about Shakespeare&#x2019;s The Tempest? That&apos;s got a wizard in it too.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Well, yes indeed. But Shakespeare on the beach isn&apos;t quite right for me, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Right. Well, today we&apos;re talking about how the poorer and more <strong>remote</strong> - or distant - parts of the world can get access to learning.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>That&apos;s right. But before we start, Neil, I believe you have a quiz question for us.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Yes, I do. I would like to know what the proportion of the world&apos;s population that still has no internet access is. Is it...</p>
<p><span>a) a quarter?<br></span>b) half?<br>or c) two thirds?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I&apos;m going to go for c) two thirds.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right or wrong later on in the programme. So Catherine, how can these people get connected to the internet and start surfing?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>By using the Outernet.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>The Outer what?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>The Outernet. That&apos;s the idea of entrepreneur Syed Karim and its goal is to give people in unconnected communities access to information without having to use expensive mobile phones or two-way satellite networks.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>I see. And an <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, by the way, is a person who makes money by starting their own business that typically involves some financial risk.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes, I&apos;ve always fancied myself as a bit of an entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Well, you&apos;ll need money and ideas, Catherine. Have you got either of those?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I&apos;ve got ideas.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Right. OK. I get it.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>So, can you tell us how the Outernet works, Neil?</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Yes, I can. The Outernet uses existing communications satellites to store and broadcast data - <strong>broadcast</strong> means to send out signals or programmes. Special equipment on the ground <strong>picks up</strong> - or receives - the data, and this can be copied to phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>But the Outernet broadcasts data <strong>offline</strong> - which means it&apos;s not connected to the Internet. There&apos;s no communication with the internet for user - so, no emails, no chat forums. And that can be a big <strong>drawback</strong> - or disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Yes. The Outernet doesn&apos;t provide two-way communication. But let&apos;s hear Syed Karim discussing why one-way access has some advantages. And see if you can spot another word meaning &apos;two-way&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br> <strong><span>Syed Karim, business entrepreneur<br></span></strong>Anything that is related to bi-directional communications, the internet, to be able to provide that to the entire world, those are billion dollar projects, multi-billion dollar projects with huge time horizons and enormous complexity. And, you know, our solution that we are offering is instantaneous, I mean, it exists right now.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Did you get it? Another way of saying two-way is <strong>bi-directional</strong>. So what are the advantages of <strong>one-way</strong> communication, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It&apos;s significantly cheaper. Bi-directional communications are multi-billion dollar projects. But the Outernet allows poorer communities to benefit from access to information.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Yes, it does. And the other big problem is the time it would take to establish two-way access. Syed says these projects have huge <strong>time horizons</strong> - and this means the length of time it takes to complete a project - they&apos;re huge, so very big.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>But the Outernet is already providing access to some of the world&apos;s most valuable knowledge. &#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>That&apos;s right. The project aims to create a library of information taken from websites including Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg, which is a collection of copyright-free e-books. <strong>Copyright-free</strong> means the right to use material without paying any fees.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>That sounds good. But let&apos;s go back to the internet and hear from a BBC reporter talking about another project which aims to get people connected.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br> <strong><span>BBC reporter<br></span></strong>Google for example is working on Project Loon, a network of high-altitude helium balloons, which will boost Internet connections across much wider areas beyond coverage from conventional masts.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>It&apos;s called Project <strong>Loon</strong> - meaning crazy - because Google thought it was such a crazy idea, and loon sounds like balloon!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah. The idea is that users will connect to the <strong>balloon network</strong> - or group of interconnected balloons - using an antenna attached to their building. The signal travels through the balloon network from balloon to balloon, and then to a station on the ground that&apos;s connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>The balloons will <strong>boost</strong> - or increase - the number of people who will be able to access the Internet.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes, it will. And that&apos;s because there will be lots of them - compared to the number of <strong>masts</strong> - or tall metal towers that send and receive signals - that are currently used.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>OK, let&apos;s have the answer to the quiz question I asked: What proportion of the world&apos;s population still has no internet access? Is it ... a) a quarter? b) half? or c) two thirds?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And I said c) two thirds.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>And you were right! The answer is two thirds. Well done, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Now just time to listen to today&apos;s words once again. Catherine.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>OK. We heard:</p>

<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. I hope you enjoyed connecting with us today! Please join us again soon.</p>
