<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>And I&apos;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Now Rob, you look like you enjoy a good meal.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Ha. Well, I do like eating out and I like to think I know a good meal when I have one.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well that should give you an advantage with today&#x2019;s quiz. In 2016, which is the last year we have statistics for, how many restaurants and mobile food services were there in the UK? Was it:<br>a) about 75,000,<br>b) about 83,000, or<br>c) about 93,000?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, I know there are a lot, so I&#x2019;m going to say 93,000 &#x2013; but that is just a guess.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I&#x2019;ll reveal the answer a little later in the programme. Today we&#x2019;re talking about being a foodie. Rob, what is a foodie?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well I would describe a foodie as someone who has a strong interest in food. They like preparing it as well as eating it &#x2013; they like using good ingredients and they&#x2019;re probably not fans of fast food.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Angela Hartnett is one of Britain&#x2019;s top chefs. In the BBC podcast The Bottom Line she talked about this topic. In this first clip how does she describe people who say they are foodies?</p>
<p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br>I think people who say they are foodies buy the books, watch TV and will cook a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>She is saying that people who say they are foodies may not actually know that much about food. They buy books and watch cookery programmes on TV and will cook a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>A little bit is a common phrase that means &#x2018;a small amount&#x2019; and if you do something a little bit it means you don&#x2019;t do it a lot. You could just say &#x2018;a little&#x2019;, but adding &#x2018;bit&#x2019; to the phrase makes it very natural.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, we heard a little bit of Angela Hartnett there. Let&#x2019;s hear more now. What&#x2019;s her description of a foodie?</p>
<p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br>My idea of a foodie is the very European idea that people go and shop every day, they understand one end of a pig from another. And maybe that&apos;s a bit romantic but I look at my mother, I look at my grandmother and our background, you know. They made food, they knew about what was expensive, they knew about quality and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Rob, do you know one end of a pig from another?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>I hope so, but the point Angela Hartnett is making is that a true foodie has a good understanding, for example, of the different parts of an animal that are used in cooking and what they are used for. She says that idea might be a bit romantic.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>We normally think of the word romantic when we are talking about love and relationships, but that&#x2019;s not what it means here, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>No. Romantic can also describe a pleasant ideal - an imaginary perfect way of life that forgets about the difficult things of everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Less hear some more from chef Angela Hartnett now. What is she worried about?</p>
<p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br>I think we think we&apos;re foodies but I think food is expensive in this country. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s affordable for lots of people and I think we are in danger of not knowing, you know, how to cook any more, how to make a meal for a family of four for five pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So Rob, what is Angela Hartnett worried about?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>She commented that food was very expensive here in Britain. Many people don&#x2019;t have enough money to buy it, as she said it&#x2019;s not affordable. She thinks we might be in danger of not being able to feed out families cheaply.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Can you say a bit more about the phrase in danger of?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Sure, the phrase to be in danger of is followed by a gerund and it means that there is the possibility of something bad happening. It&#x2019;s not happened yet, but it could happen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Thanks Rob. Right, well we&#x2019;re in danger of running out of time so let&#x2019;s get to the answer to the question I asked at the start of the programme. I asked how many restaurants or mobile food services there were in the UK in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>And I said &#x2013; it was a guess &#x2013; 93,000. But was I right?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re 10,000 out! The answer is approximately 83,000.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Right, well I&#x2019;ve still got a few more to get to before I can tick them all off my list!</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Me too! Well, before we go, let&#x2019;s recap the words and phrases we talked about today. The first was foodie.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, foodie is a modern word to describe someone who is very interested in all aspects of food, from buying, preparing and cooking to eating.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And someone who may or may not know which end of a pig is which!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>I think you&#x2019;re being a little bit silly there, aren&#x2019;t you?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well a little bit was our next phrase, wasn&#x2019;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, a little bit: a very simple but a very natural conversational phrase that means a small amount.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>The next word was the adjective romantic. Not used in the context of love here though was it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>No, it wasn&apos;t. A romantic idea here is one that is not realistic but is an imagined perfect situation. For example, we have a very romantic view of our childhoods when every Christmas was a white Christmas and every summer holiday was baking hot and spent on the beach. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t like that at all. In reality both Christmas and summer were cold and rainy.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Then we had the adjective affordable, for something we have enough money to buy. Finally the phrase to be in danger of.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, for the possibility of something bad happening.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Bye-bye!</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well I have to say, I&#x2019;m a little bit hungry and if I don&#x2019;t get some food soon I&#x2019;m in danger of getting very grumpy.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>You&apos;re always grumpy, Neil. But there is a very affordable caf&#xE9; around the corner, let&#x2019;s head over there now, shall we?</p>
