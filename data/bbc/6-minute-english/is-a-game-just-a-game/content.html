<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>...and I&apos;m Finn. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Rob&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br></strong>Hello, Finn. Did you have a good weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yeah, it was OK thanks although, you know, I&apos;m a bit tired now.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Why&apos;s that?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It&apos;s a bit embarrassing but I stayed up all night playing a computer game.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>All night?! You must be addicted. <strong>Addicted</strong>, by the way, means unable to stop doing something.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, maybe today&apos;s programme might have some advice for me.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s right. Today we&apos;re discussing whether computer games are bad for our health - and in particular - bad for children.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, Rob, why don&apos;t you wake me up a little bit by asking me today&apos;s quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK - here goes. In America, what percentage of people who play computer games are female? Is it...</p>
<p>a) 28%</p>
<p>b) 38%</p>
<p>or c) 48%</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, I do know a few female gamers so how about b) 38%.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, right. Go for the middle option? We&apos;ll find out if that&apos;s the right answer later on. OK, so what kind of computer games do you like to play, Finn?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, I quite like those role-playing games. You know, the fantasy role-playing games.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well,<strong> role playing</strong> is where you create your own characters and stories in a <strong>fantasy</strong> - or imaginary - world. But, to be honest, those kind of games aren&apos;t really <strong>up my alley</strong> - which means they&apos;re not really suited to my tastes or abilities. Any other kind of games you like, Finn?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yeah, I also quite like <strong>shoot-&apos;em-up</strong> games. These are games where you have to do a lot of shooting and there&apos;s a lot of violence.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It&apos;s funny because you don&apos;t strike me as a violent person, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I&apos;m not, at all. I wouldn&apos;t hurt a fly, Rob! But maybe shooting people on a computer screen seems a bit more harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. And<strong> not to hurt a fly</strong> means to be gentle and unwilling to make people unhappy. And <strong>harmless</strong> means unlikely to hurt or upset anyone. Well, let&apos;s hear Internet safety advisor Alan MacKenzie discussing how adult computer games can have a negative effect on children.</p>
<p><strong>Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor<br></strong>Many people understandably will just think that a game is just a game and not realising the explicit content that&apos;s in there - and as you suggest, the violence and sexualisation of women in particular, which is wholly inappropriate for anybody, never mind children.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, you know, if you want my opinion, Rob, a game is just a game. It&apos;s generally a harmless form of entertainment. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>I&apos;m torn</strong>, actually - meaning I&apos;m unable to decide. Most people, like you Finn, probably aren&apos;t affected by what you see in computer games. But we can&apos;t ignore the small percentage of people who are affected.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s true really, isn&apos;t it, Rob? And whilst playing computer games all night doesn&apos;t make me violent, it certainly makes me very tired!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I can see that. But also Finn - when do you and your wife actually talk to each other - when you&apos;re in your own computer fantasy world for hours on end?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yeah, it&apos;s not great, is it? And <strong>for hours on end</strong> means a long time, by the way! So, I don&apos;t know. Maybe if she played as well, then we could have some virtual conversations...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that sounds ridiculous! But let&apos;s move on. Alan talks about <strong>explicit content</strong> in games. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That means showing things in an open and direct way. So some adult games contain open violence and sexualisation.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And shall we explain what <strong>sexualisation</strong> means?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. It means making someone or something sexual - and in this case, women. This might be through the shape of a woman&apos;s body, or the clothes she wears, or the way she behaves in these games.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Alan says this type of explicit content - violent or sexual - is inappropriate for computer games. And <strong>inappropriate</strong> means not the right thing for a particular situation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And he is worried about children accessing this type of content. Let&apos;s hear more from him. What advice does he give?</p>
<p><strong>Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor<br></strong>So it&apos;s a matter of educating the parents and the wider community in these issues, and making them aware of the type of content that&apos;s in there, and why it&apos;s inappropriate, and the effects that it may be having on their children and their behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Alan thinks it&apos;s the responsibility of parents and the <strong>wider community</strong> - now that means other groups of people, such as friends, relatives and teachers for example - to check on what children are viewing and playing.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>But this will only work if they understand which types of content are OK and which aren&apos;t.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That&apos;s right. So the adults need educating too. They need to be shown.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, that&apos;s right. So I&apos;ll be checking on your behaviour from now on, Finn!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, That&apos;s probably a good idea. So, let&apos;s hear the answer to today&apos;s quiz question next.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes and I asked you, in America, what percentage of people who play computer games are female? Is it... a) 28% b) 38% or c) 48%?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And I went for the middle option, as usual, and I said b) 38%.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you are wrong, this time Finn! The answer is actually c) 48%. Are you surprised by that?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>Yes and no. I think a lot more people are playing games in general, so lots of them must be women.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Absolutely. Why not? OK, shall we now listen to the words we learned today?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Good idea. We heard:</p>
<p>addicted<br>fantasy<br>up your alley<br>shoot &apos;em up<br>not to hurt a fly<br>harmless<br>for hours on end<br>explicit content<br>sexualisation<br>inappropriate<br>wider community&#xA0;</p>
