<p><strong>Gibbons</strong> belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>. They are small apes that live in South East Asia. When they communicate with each other they sound like they are singing &#x2013; and some sing in <strong>duets</strong> &#x2013; but why?</p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>And hello! I&apos;m Neil.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well I&#x2019;m sitting right next to you, Rob?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Very funny.&#xA0;Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>.&#xA0; The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don&#x2019;t.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I didn&#x2019;t know that. On a serious note&#x2026; I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>OK. If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>, then!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Well, today&#x2019;s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. <strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil&#x2019;s monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Musical apes &#x2013; that&#x2019;s nice! So how about today&#x2019;s quiz question, Rob?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon&#x2019;s voice travel through the forest? Is it&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span>a) 500m</span></p>
<p><span>b) 1km</span></p>
<p><span>or c) 5km?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I&#x2019;m going to say b) 1km.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>You&#x2019;ve never heard one.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Never heard one&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>OK. We&#x2019;ll find out later on in the programme whether you&#x2019;re right or wrong. Now let&#x2019;s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University <br></strong></span><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let&#x2019;s just hear this. [gibbons calling] That&#x2019;s an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn&#x2019;t it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is &#x2026; I said talking to each other. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Well this is their&#x2026; They&#x2019;re singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What we call a duet.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And they&#x2019;ll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>It is. And what&#x2019;s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs &#x2013; one male and one female. They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together. So a duet is a song sung by two people &#x2013; or in this case, sung by two gibbons!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time &#x2013; which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>. Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>And that could easily describe us singing together! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Let&#x2019;s not do that.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>But what&#x2019;s the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong> &#x2013; or bit of land &#x2013; belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong>Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong> &#x2013; or warn &#x2013; other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong> &#x2013; these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet &#x2018;hoo hoo&#x2019; call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter &#x2018;hoo hoo&#x2019; call for an eagle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You&#x2019;re very good at that Rob. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now let&#x2019;s hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University</span></strong><br><span>Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Right. And ancestor means an animal &#x2013; or human &#x2013; from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons &#x2013; then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for &#x2018;leopard&#x2019; and another for &#x2018;eagle&#x2019;.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>OK, let&#x2019;s have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon&#x2019;s voice travel through the forest? Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And I said b) 1km. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today&#x2019;s words again maybe in a gibbon&apos;s voice Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&#x2019;m not sure about that. I&#x2019;ll do it in a human voice. </span></p>
