<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Alice. So Neil, the subject of today&apos;s show is superheroes! Who&apos;s your favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Spiderman. He&apos;s cool and funny &#x2013; and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;ve never heard of her &#x2013; and I&#x2019;m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can&#x2019;t relate to. And they&apos;re hungry for characters a little <strong>closer to home</strong> &#x2013; or relevant to their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So what&apos;s Ms Marvel&apos;s super power?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>She&apos;s a <strong>shape shifter</strong> &#x2013; which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she&apos;s also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today&apos;s quiz question, Alice!</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br> </strong>OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) Miles Morales?<br>b) Riri Williams?<br>Or c) Jane Foster?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both <strong>contaminated</strong> &#x2013; or poisoned &#x2013; by radioactive substances that change their DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What about Batman and Iron Man? They&apos;re just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Good point. There don&apos;t seem to be any <strong>hard-and-fast</strong> &#x2013; or clear &#x2013; rules. But these special powers &#x2013; whether it&apos;s being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs &#x2013; they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that&#x2019;s a big theme across all comic books.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often <strong>blur</strong> the line between right and wrong &#x2013; making things unclear. Superheroes don&#x2019;t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Let&apos;s hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London<br></span></strong><span>They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of&#x2026; one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So publishers &#x2013; like Marvel Comics &#x2013; <strong>imbued</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or filled &#x2013; their characters with human problems. I can&apos;t imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things &#x2013; or bickering with his wife!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>bickering</strong></span><span> means arguing about things that aren&apos;t important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more </span><strong><span>diverse</span></strong><span> &#x2013; or varied &#x2013; readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities &#x2013; who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they&apos;ve been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, it isn&apos;t. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the <strong>manga</strong> &#x2013; these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what &#x2013; there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Really?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes. Let&#x2019;s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.</span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London<br></span></strong><span>One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it&apos;s one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>It&apos;s particularly interesting that being an artist is an <strong>autonomous</strong> career &#x2013; meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man &#x2013; the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let&apos;s go to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked you: what&apos;s the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) Miles Morales?<br>b) Riri Williams?<br>Or c) Jane Foster?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said Miles Morales.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were&#x2026; wrong, Neil. I&apos;m sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor&apos;s hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Very interesting. Now, let&apos;s remind ourselves of the words we learned today:<br>closer to home<br>shape shifter<br>contaminated<br>hard and fast<br>blur<br>imbued<br>bicker<br>diverse<br>manga<br>autonomous</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!</p></div>
