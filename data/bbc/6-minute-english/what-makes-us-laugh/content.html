<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>&#x2026; and I&apos;m Neil. OK Alice, I&apos;ve got something for you here&#x2026; a question&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Ready? What is the Mexican version of One Direction?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Um&#x2026; No idea.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Juan Direction. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Very good&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br><em>Juan</em> Direction... You know?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes, yes, I get it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Never mind. Can you guess what the subject of today&apos;s show is instead?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Is it bad jokes?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Come on! That was a good little gag! Yes. The subject of today&apos;s show is&#x2026; what makes us laugh. And in this context, to get something, for example a gag &#x2013; or joke, means to understand it. We all like to laugh &#x2013; well not you apparently &#x2013; but most of us do! It&apos;s good for our health, it reduces stress and releases feel-good hormones in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>OK, thank you, Neil. But how about answering today&apos;s quiz question? Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) risology?<br>b) gelotology?<br>or c) comology?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>That&apos;s difficult and I&apos;m going to say c) comology because it&apos;s got the word &apos;comedy&apos; in it, you see?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Oh, very good. OK. Well, we&apos;ll find out later if you&apos;re right. Now, did you know, we rarely laugh when we&apos;re on our own? Laughter is a social thing that we generally like to share with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Really? I laugh when I&apos;m watching cartoons on my own &#x2013; don&apos;t you, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>No, Neil, I don&apos;t. Anyway, some researchers believe that the purpose of laughter is related to the way we bond with each other. And the more we laugh, the more we bond as a group.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Interesting idea. It could explain why stand-up comedy &#x2013; where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience &#x2013; is very popular entertainment. But what does it take to keep your audience laughing? Let&#x2019;s listen to Steve Byrne, a successful US comedian talking about this.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br>The one single thing an aspiring comedian should do is to write, write, write and talk about the things that make them laugh. Selfishness &#x2013; time to be selfish &#x2013; time to be a little narcissistic. What is it that makes you laugh? Because that will get you closer to finding your voice. Because ultimately that&apos;s why people come see you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So comedians need to be selfish and narcissistic &#x2013; that sounds pretty negative!</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes, it does. Narcissistic means being too interested in yourself &#x2013; for example your appearance or other personal qualities. And aspiring means wanting to be successful in your chosen career.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And what does Steve mean when he says comedians need to find their voice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, he means they need to talk about what they think in a way that&apos;s unique &#x2013; meaning unusual or special &#x2013; to them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK. Let&apos;s listen to Steve again talking about turning 40 and what he finds funny about that.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br>When you turn 40 you will hear this in your life and hopefully you&apos;ll hear this the rest of your life. &apos;You look good for 40. You look good for 52. You look great for 63.&apos; You never hear that when you&apos;re young. You never hear: &apos;You look good for 19.&apos;<br><br>You think there&apos;s going to be some magic potion &#x2013; some magic shortcut to it all. It&apos;s writing and getting up on stage. It takes a lot of perseverance and it&apos;s such a competitive occupation. You know, you&apos;ve just got to outwork everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, we heard Steve making his audience laugh there. And by the way, Alice, you look fantastic for 40.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>That&apos;s not funny, Neil. I&apos;m only 39 and you know it. Anyway, moving on, Steve says there&apos;s no magic potion or shortcut to success. You have to work hard &#x2013; it doesn&apos;t happen by itself. And perseverance means to keep on trying to achieve something even when it&apos;s difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>He says you have to outwork everybody &#x2013; which means to work harder than everybody else. Steve certainly doesn&apos;t make comedy sound much fun, does he?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>No. In fact some people say there&apos;s a connection between depression and comedy &#x2013; that comedians can be introverted and depressive.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Is that right? Introverts are generally quiet people who are more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes, you&apos;d think that most comedians would be extroverts &#x2013; people who are lively and enjoy the company of others. OK I think it&apos;s time for the answer to our quiz question, Neil. I asked: Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it&#x2026;<br><br>a) risology?<br>b) gelotology?<br>or c) comology?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes. I said c) comology, which I think I&apos;m beginning to regret now.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes, well, indeed. Sorry, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s the wrong answer. It&apos;s actually b) gelotology &#x2013; which comes from the Greek word, gelos, meaning laughter.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK. You can stop sniggering now, Alice and just tell us today&apos;s words once again?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>Alright then. Here they are:<br>get something (e.g. a joke)<br>gag<br>stand-up comedy<br>narcissistic<br>aspiring<br>unique<br>perseverance<br>outwork<br>introverts<br>extroverts</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, that just about brings us to the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong><br>See you next time.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong><br>Bye.</p></div>
