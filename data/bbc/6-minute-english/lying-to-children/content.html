<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And I&apos;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Rob, when you were a child, did you have a pet?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, we had a few pets. My favourite was a little fluffy hamster.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And what happened to your hamster?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well one day I got home from school and he wasn&#x2019;t in his cage. I was worried for a bit in case he&#x2019;d escaped or got hurt, but it was alright. My mum told me that he had gone to live on a farm so that he could run around with other animals.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, really.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A hamster. Went to live on a farm. To be with other animals. Really?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh, well, when you put it like that.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I think that was probably one of those lies that parents tell their children so as not to make them sad.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well I&#x2019;m sad now</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well maybe having a go at this quiz will cheer you up. According to a study by a US psychologist, what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation?</p>
<p>Is it:<br>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 40%</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 50%, or</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 60%?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I think most people don&#x2019;t lie that much, so I&#x2019;ll say 40%.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll reveal the answer a little later in the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So today we are talking about lies and particularly the lies that parents tell children.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>The topic was discussed on the BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman&#x2019;s Hour.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>A guest on that programme was Doctor Chris Boyle, a psychologist at Exeter University. He talks about a particular kind of lie. We tell these lies not because we want to hurt people. What colour are these lies called?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Chris Boyle<br></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> &#x2013; as long as there&apos;s not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it&apos;s something that we do. It&apos;s almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it&apos;s become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dr Chris Boyle there. What colour is the kind of lie he was talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong>. He says a <strong>white</strong> <strong>lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion </strong>of the truth. <strong>Distortion</strong> here means a changing or bending of the truth. These kind of lies are OK as long as we don&#x2019;t tell them because we want to hurt someone.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>He used the phrase <strong>malicious intent </strong>to talk about a bad reason for doing something, didn&#x2019;t he?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, <strong>intent</strong> is the reason or purpose for doing something and <strong>malicious</strong> is an adjective which means cruel or nasty. So <em>without</em> <strong>malicious intent</strong> means without wanting to hurt or be cruel to someone.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>He said that this kind of <strong>white lie</strong> was almost a <strong>societal norm</strong>. Can you explain what he means by that?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, something that is the <strong>norm </strong>is something that is expected, it&#x2019;s regular and usual.The adjective <strong>societal </strong>comes from the noun society. So a <strong>societal norm</strong> is something that is regular and common in your culture or society.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So do you think your mum&#x2019;s story about the hamster and the farm was a little white lie?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I&#x2019;m sure it was. She didn&#x2019;t do it with <strong>malicious intent</strong> - she didn&#x2019;t want to hurt me. In fact, just the opposite, she wanted to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, that&#x2019;s one kind of <strong>white lie </strong>that parents tell, to protect children. There are also a couple of other reasons. One being the parent&#x2019;s convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I remember my mum telling me on certain days, the park wasn&#x2019;t open. I know now that it never closed, I guess at the time she was just too busy to take me.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And then there are the cultural lies that parents tell children.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well first, if you have any children listening to this right now, you might want to cover their ears for a few seconds. RobI&#x2019;m talking about, for example, Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, there&#x2019;s no <strong>malicious intent </strong>in telling children those stories. It is a cultural and <strong>societal norm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Let&#x2019;s listen to Dr Chris Boyle again talking about <strong>white lies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Chris Boyle&#xA0;<br></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> &#x2013; as long as there&apos;s not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it&apos;s something that we do. It&apos;s almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it&apos;s become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So now back to our question at the top of the programme. I asked what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation. Was it:</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 40%</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 50%, or</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 60%</p>
<p>What did you say Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I said a) just 40%.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well I&apos;m afraid the answer was 60%.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Really? Goodness 60%! That&apos;s more than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right, well before we go, let&#x2019;s recap the vocabulary we talked about today. The first expression was &apos;<strong>white lie&apos;. </strong>A lie we tell without meaning to hurt someone, for example when I say to you &#x2013; you look nice today!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Wait, what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But that is actually a <strong>distortion </strong>of the truth. A changing or bending of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Mmmm. This makes me think of the next expression, &apos;<strong>malicious intent&apos;</strong>. <strong>Intent </strong>is the reason or purpose for doing something, and doing something with a <strong><em>malicious</em> intent </strong>is doing it deliberately to be cruel or to hurt someone. I think you have <strong>a malicious intent</strong>, telling me that when you say I look nice, it&#x2019;s just a lie!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&#x2019;m just kidding!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&#x2019;s the <strong>norm</strong> for you, isn&#x2019;t it, just kidding. A &apos;<strong>norm&apos; </strong>is the standard or &#x2018;normal&#x2019; way that something is. In the clip we heard &apos;<strong>societal norm&apos; </strong>whichis the accepted or &#x2018;normal&#x2019; way something is done in society.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>For example, telling children about Father Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Sssh! But yes you&apos;re right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, sadly this isn&#x2019;t a lie but that&apos;s all for this programme.
