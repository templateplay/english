<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;<br><br><strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Neil.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Have you ever played SimCity, Neil &#x2013; the city-building computer game?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, but I wasn&apos;t very good at it. I didn&apos;t build enough houses, which created a lot of homeless Sims &#x2013; those are the characters in the game. And then I didn&apos;t deal effectively with a flood&#x2026;<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Really? Well, I suppose managing a city is quite a challenge &#x2013; which is the subject of today&apos;s show: cities of the future &#x2013; an important subject as so many of us now live in urban areas. I want to start with our quiz question: What is the percentage of the world&apos;s population that will be living in cities in 2050? We&apos;re dealing with approximates here. Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 10%?<br>b) 50%?<br>Or c) 70%?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>I think that it&apos;s a) 10%.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right or wrong later on in the show. Now, you&apos;ve encountered a couple of issues that might face urban planners when designing a city, Neil &#x2013; housing and dealing with a flood. Can you think of any others?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Having decent cycle lanes. Good transport networks are very important.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes indeed, and if people could get around easily on foot, or by bike, or by public transport, roads would be less <strong>congested</strong> &#x2013; or overcrowded &#x2013; and less polluted. That sounds rather utopian to me though.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>A <strong>utopia</strong> is an imaginary place where everything is perfect. But Copenhagen is pretty utopian, Alice - t<span>he air is clean, there are bike lanes everywhere.<br><br></span><strong>Alice<br></strong>That sounds fantastic, but what about somewhere like Beijing with its constant <strong>smog</strong> &#x2013; or air pollution &#x2013; hanging over the city? A lot of people ride bikes there too. So which city is going to be the model for the future?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Maybe like the future Los Angeles in the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> &#x2013; you know, glittering high-rises, gigantic neon billboards, flying cars&#x2026;<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, today&apos;s Los Angeles has terrible urban sprawl and traffic problems.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Urban sprawl</strong> is the way a city spreads into undeveloped land around it, often without planning permission.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Dr Janice Pearlman can explain why this happens. She is the founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization in Rio de Janeiro and knows a lot about urban sprawl in Brazilian cities.<br><br><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>Dr Janice Pearlman, founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization, Rio de Janeiro<br></span></strong><span>People are coming massively into the cities which have no housing that&apos;s affordable to them. So they can&apos;t rent and they can&apos;t buy, and they end up building their own communities and houses on unoccupied land. And these communities are becoming in some places the majority not the minority and they&apos;re off the grid so they&apos;re not often serviced by either the social services but also many of them don&apos;t have water, sanitation and electricity.<br><br></span><strong>Neil<br></strong>People <strong>migrate</strong> &#x2013; or move &#x2013; from the countryside to the city to get better opportunities, but end up with nowhere to live.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>So they build their own housing on unoccupied land. These <strong>shanty towns</strong> &#x2013; poor communities where the houses are built out of cheap materials like corrugated iron and plastic sheeting &#x2013; are often <strong>off the grid</strong>&#x2026;<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Which means they don&apos;t have an electricity or water supply &#x2013; or access to healthcare and education. And these communities are growing, so the problem is getting bigger. So are there any solutions, Alice?<br><br><strong>Alice</strong></p>
<p>Well, it&apos;s all about improving the <strong>infrastructure</strong>. That&apos;s the basic facilities a town or city needs, for example: communication, transport, water, and electricity. But this shouldn&apos;t only mean improving housing conditions, but also promoting education and employment among the inhabitants, and building better communities.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>That sounds like a real headache for the urban planners.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>You&apos;re right there. And one thing urban planners are talking about at the moment is creating &apos;smart cities&apos;. John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, explains what it is.<br><br><strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong><span>John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, New York City<br></span></strong><span>I think, you know, generally it&apos;s accepted that cloud computing, ubiquitous internet, robust 5G networks etc, will transform our cities, whether they&apos;re in the global south or the developed world. And, you know, technology is really a game changer, I think, in urbanisation.<br><br></span><strong>Neil<br></strong>John Rossant there. What&apos;s <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, Alice?<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>It means available everywhere. So, the idea behind smart cities is to use technology to collect large amounts of data about how a city is performing.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>And that will be a <strong>game changer</strong> &#x2013; significantly affecting the way our cities function.Hope for the future, Alice?<strong><br><br></strong><strong>Alice<br></strong>Fingers crossed. Now, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question, Neil. I asked: What is the percentage of the world&apos;s population that will be living in cities in 2050? And remember I said we are dealing with approximates here? Is it&#x2026;&#xA0; a) 10%? b) 50%? Or c) 70%?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) 10%.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and you underestimated there, Neil. The right answer is actually c) 70%. This, according to a report by the United Nations. Today 54% of the world&#x2019;s population lives in urban areas.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>A lot really!<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yeah.<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I know we&apos;re running out of time, so let me repeat the words we learned today. They were:<br>congested<br>utopia<br>smog<br>urban sprawl<br>migrate<br>shanty towns<br>off the grid<br>infrastructure<br>ubiquitous<br>game changer<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.
