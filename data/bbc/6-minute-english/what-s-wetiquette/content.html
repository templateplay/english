<p><strong>Rob<br></strong><span>Hi, I&apos;m Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we talk about an interesting topic and six items of related vocabulary.<span><br></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&#x2019;m Neil&#x2026; And today we&#x2019;re talking about wetiquette! What&#x2019;s that, Rob?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I have no idea!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you won&#x2019;t find wetiquette in many dictionaries &#x2013; it actually means &#x2018;swimming pool etiquette&#x2019;. W-etiquette &#x2013; get it? Etiquette is a set of rules for how to behave in social situations. And wetiquette is a set of dos and don&#x2019;ts to keep things calm in the water.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span>Dos and don&#x2019;ts</strong> are also rules telling us how to behave. So things like &#x2018;No running by the pool&#x2019; or &#x2018;No diving in the shallow end&#x2019;. Am I right?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Yes and no, Rob. Those are traditional swimming pool rules. But wetiquette covers slightly different things.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>OK, well before we get to those, I have a question for you, Neil. According to the US Water Quality and Health Council, how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) 7%,<br>b) 17% or<br>c) 70%.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Well, I&#x2019;m going to be optimistic and say 7%, Rob.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><span><br>So I take it you do always take a shower before swimming, Neil?<span><br></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Correct. Taking a quick shower is such an easy thing to do, and it stops all that horrible sweat and bacteria getting in the pool water! I can&#x2019;t understand why some people don&#x2019;t do it!<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I can see it&#x2019;s making you quite <strong>hot under the collar </strong>- and that means angry. Let&#x2019;s listen to swimming specialist, Jenny Landreth, talking about what annoys her.<strong><br><br><strong>INSERT<br></strong>Jenny Landreth, swimming specialist, interviewed by the BBC</strong><br><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> I&apos;m very keen on my wetiquette in the pool.<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It&apos;s that thing where people can get quite cross about, which is: Do you go around clockwise or anticlockwise? Do you overtake or not?<br><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> People need a rule. We need to observe the rules of the pool and I&apos;m very keen on that. Most other swimmers will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool. And don&#x2019;t know how to observe the rules of that lane.<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Lane rage &#x2013; you mean if you&#x2019;re a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast lane?<br><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> Well, I hate to say it, but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed and think they&#x2019;re slightly faster than they are.<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ah! The male ego here!<br><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> They quite often don&#x2019;t like it if there&#x2019;s a woman swimming faster than them. So very often they&#x2019;ll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetiquette to get in the correct lane.<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Know your speed.<br><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> That was Jenny Landreth &#x2013; a swimming specialist &#x2013; talking about the things that annoy her about other people in the pool.<span data-mce-mark="1"><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> Yes. Jenny doesn&apos;t like it when people are slower that they should be for the fast lane. Older men, like you, Rob.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br> Neil, how dare you! Yes, Jenny gets &apos;lane rage&apos;.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Lane rage! Where swimmers get hot under the collar when there&#x2019;s a slow swimmer in the fast lane.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Swimming <strong>lanes</strong> are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as &#x2018;fast&#x2019;, &#x2018;medium&#x2019;, and &#x2018;slow&#x2019;. Do you know your speed, Neil?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Yes &#x2013; I&#x2019;m fast.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Are you sure you are not misjudging your speed? Do you think you might actually be a medium-fast swimmer?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>To <strong>misjudge</strong> means to guess something wrongly. And our <strong>ego</strong> is the idea we have of ourselves &#x2013; with regards to how important we feel we are. And to answer your question, Rob, no, I&#x2019;m definitely fast.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob <span><br></span></strong>Are there other things swimmers should be aware of in the pool?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Yes &#x2013; if somebody taps your foot, it means they want to overtake you.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span>Overtaking </strong>means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>I hate it when swimmers overtake me!<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Really, Neil? Is that your male ego talking?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>No, not at all &#x2013; I just hate getting splashed.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>I see. Well perhaps now is a good time to move on and hear the answer to today&#x2019;s quiz question. Remember I asked: How many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it&#x2026; a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>I said 7% and I hope I&#x2019;m right.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Well, I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re wrong, Neil. It&#x2019;s actually ten times that amount &#x2013; it&#x2019;s 70%! The 2012 US report from Water Quality and Health Council found that around 70% of people do not shower before taking a swim in the pool &#x2013; adding to the number of germs in the water.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Perhaps swimming pools should start fining people who don&#x2019;t take a shower? That might make a difference. Now, let&#x2019;s go over the words we learned today.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Yes, the first one is &#x2018;dos and don&#x2019;ts&#x2019;, which are rules telling us how to behave in a particular situation. For example, &#x201C;What are the dos and don&#x2019;ts of meeting the Queen?&#x201D;<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Good question &#x2013; Is the correct etiquette to call her Your Highness or Ma&#x2019;am? Are there certain subjects you shouldn&#x2019;t talk about?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Do you shake her hand or curtsy?<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>These are things you need to know &#x2013; or else the Queen might get &#x2018;hot under collar&#x2019; &#x2013; that&#x2019;s our next word, and it means angry!<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>&#x201C;Both politicians got hot under the collar and insulted each other.&#x201D;<strong><span><br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK &#x2013; number three is &#x2018;lanes&#x2019; &#x2013; which are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as &#x2018;fast&#x2019;, &#x2018;medium&#x2019;, and &#x2018;slow&#x2019;.<strong><span><br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>&#x201C;Our British Olympic gold medallist is swimming in lane one.&#x201D;<strong><span><br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>Our next word is &#x2018;misjudge&#x2019; which means to guess something wrongly. For example, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry I misjudged you, Rob. Please forgive me.&#x201D;<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>Oh alright then, Neil. But don&#x2019;t misjudge me again OK? Next up is &#x2018;ego&#x2019; &#x2013; which is our sense of how important we are.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>&#x201C;Losing the race was a huge blow to her ego.&#x201D;<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<span><br></span></strong>And our final word is &#x2018;overtake&#x2019; &#x2013; which means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<span><br></span></strong>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t enjoy overtaking big lorries on the motorway.&#x201D;<strong><span><span><br></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Neither do I, Neil. Now one of the don&#x2019;ts of this show is not talking for more than six minutes. So it&#x2019;s time to say goodbye!<strong><span><br></span></strong></p>
