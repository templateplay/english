<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p><em>This is not a word for word transcript</em></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English &#x2013; the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I&#x2019;m Neil. Today we&#x2019;re talking about jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I&#x2019;m Dan. And specifically, we&#x2019;re looking at the trend for having more than one job&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. On that note &#x2013; Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? &#x201C;What do you want to be when you grow up?&#x201D; Do you remember your answer?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That doesn&#x2019;t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It&#x2019;s one reason why more and more people have what we call <strong>portfolio </strong>careers these days &#x2013; so they can do a bit of everything.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A <strong>portfolio</strong>, as a noun, means &apos;a case for carrying large pictures &#x2013; or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things &#x2013; in this case, careers.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a <strong>portfolio</strong> career.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Sounds like a good combination. First, let&#x2019;s do today&#x2019;s question &#x2013; it&#x2019;s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as&#x2026; bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Farmers<br>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Spies<br>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Guards</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It can&#x2019;t be spies, can it? So I&#x2019;m going to guess guards. C.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Great, well let&#x2019;s find out at the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, the <strong>portfolio</strong> career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don&#x2019;t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Which specific example of a <strong>portfolio</strong> career does she mention?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&#xA0;<br></strong><strong>Emily Wapnick, Author<br></strong>More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs - and it&#x2019;s not just <strong>to make ends meet</strong>. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They&#x2019;ve got, you know, &#xA0;three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they&#x2019;re a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong>. Or they&#x2019;ve got a career in two different areas. There&#x2019;s a guy that I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier &#x2013; he makes violins - and he&#x2019;s very successful in both.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who&#x2019;s both a psychotherapist and a luthier &#x2013; someone who makes violins.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>She says this trend is more than just about working to <strong>make ends meet</strong> &#x2013; in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression &#x2013; a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong> &#x2013; what&#x2019;s that exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses &#x2013; and the use of <strong>serial</strong> here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity &#x2013; such as a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>killer</strong> or <strong>serial</strong> <strong>murderer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Not the kind of <strong>portfolio</strong> career I had in mind. A <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast &#x2013; it&#x2019;s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it&#x2019;s wise to <strong>add another string to your bow</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A great phrase, which really just means &apos;to learn new skills you can use in the future&apos;. I&#x2019;d like to learn Japanese &#x2013; that would <strong>add another string to my bow</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So desu, ne? But choosing a <strong>portfolio</strong> career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Here&#x2019;s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term <strong>portfolio career</strong> in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&#xA0;<br></strong><strong>Charles Handy, writer<br></strong>80% of the people in <strong>corporate</strong> jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you&#x2019;re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they&#x2019;re not making an awful lot of money. It&#x2019;s a balancing job really, you&#x2019;re free but you&#x2019;re poor. Or you&#x2019;re slaved but you&#x2019;re richer.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sounds like a difficult choice &#x2013; be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&#x2019;d rather be poor and free, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, let&#x2019;s explain a term he used &#x2013; a <strong>corporate</strong> job. What does <strong>corporate</strong> mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Quite literally, it&#x2019;s the adjective from the term corporation - a <strong>corporate</strong> job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation &#x2013; usually well paid, and with certain benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Could we say James Bond has a <strong>corporate</strong> career?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today&#x2019;s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said the Bonds were guards.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&#x2019;m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years&#x2026; the spying game came much later!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed! Let&#x2019;s spy today&#x2019;s words once more. We had <strong>portfolio</strong> &#x2013; which can be used in different ways. There&#x2019;s a <strong>portfolio</strong> career, as well as the original meaning of a <strong>portfolio</strong> of art. Any others?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, people talk about a <strong>portfolio</strong> of investments &#x2013; when you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Talking of money, we had to <strong>make ends meet</strong>. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to <strong>make ends meet </strong>&#x2013; to make enough money to live on.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>. <strong>Serial</strong> means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I&#x2019;d love to start a business&#x2026; First, I need to learn a new skill - <strong>add another string to my bow</strong> and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I&#x2019;ll run a yoga business.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Not for me though, I prefer the <strong>corporate</strong> life &#x2013; a secure job in a big corporation!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>OK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work!&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Alright. <br> <br> <strong>Dan</strong><br> And that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon.</p>
