<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Catherine&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And I&apos;m Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>No, really?</span><strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Wow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don&apos;t know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say?<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London &#x2013; something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Which is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking&#x2026; if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don&apos;t I &#x2013; and other commuters in the city &#x2013; do it more often?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, that&apos;s a good question, Neil, and maybe we&apos;ll find some answers in the show, because today we&apos;re talking about why cities make us so rude.&#xA0; </span><span>And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what&apos;s the name of this chemical? Is it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) melatonin?<br></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;m going to say a) melatonin.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, we&apos;ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called &apos;Talk to me London&apos; has created these &apos;Tubechat&apos; badges that you can wear to show that you&apos;re happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one!&#xA0;<br></span><strong><br><span> Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don&apos;t know what might happen.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s true. Now, let&apos;s listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK<br></span></strong><span>When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us &#x2013; we&apos;re just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We&apos;re persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It&apos;s a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we&apos;re going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Dr Elle Boag there. And <strong>hyper vigilance</strong></span><span> means being extremely watchful of what&apos;s going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you&apos;re just one person in a crowd of others and you just don&apos;t know who might be dangerous.<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become <strong>insular</strong></span><span> &#x2013; which means inward looking.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous &#x2013; to blend in with the crowd &#x2013; and not have to talk to people!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel <strong>claustrophobic</strong></span><span> &#x2013; which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can&apos;t do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And a <strong>nosey</strong></span><span> person shows too much interest in other people&apos;s business.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Now, it&apos;s good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it&apos;s not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting &#x2013; it&apos;s about efficiency &#x2013; getting to work on time, getting things done. Let&apos;s hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster<br></span></strong><span>The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it&apos;s a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don&apos;t have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it&apos;s not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose &#x2013; it&apos;s simply that people have a destination to be.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span><strong>Success quotient</strong> means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Cities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I don&apos;t think we hustle, Neil. <strong>Hustle</strong></span><span> means to work aggressively to make money.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And <strong>chitchat</strong></span><span>, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That&apos;s what we do!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>What we do isn&apos;t chitchat, Neil! It&apos;s highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today&apos;s quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What&apos;s the name of this chemical? Is it&#x2026;<br><br></span><span>a) melatonin?<br></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And it&apos;s a) melatonin &#x2013; I&apos;m absolutely sure.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Sorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin &#x2013; a hormone commonly known as the &apos;love drug&apos;. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now, here are the words we learned today:<br></span><span>hyper vigilance<br></span><span>insular<br></span><span>claustrophobic<br></span><span>nosey<br></span><span>quotient<br></span><span>hustle<br></span><span>chitchat</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Both<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p></div>
