<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English &#x2013; the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I&#x2019;m Dan. And today we&#x2019;re talking about...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Sighing. I&#x2019;m Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Now &#x2013; was that a real sigh &#x2013; or just one to demonstrate the meaning?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, very interesting. And it&#x2019;s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Indeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today&#x2019;s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Twice</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 10 times</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 40 times</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I&#x2019;m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>OK. Let&#x2019;s find out if you&#x2019;re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let&#x2019;s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&#xA0;<br></strong><strong>Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University<br></strong>It&#x2019;s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of <strong>resetting</strong> mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don&#x2019;t sigh would eventually die. It is a<strong> survival mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So sighing keeps us alive.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Dr Barker called it a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A <strong>mechanism</strong>, here, means a system of behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, a <strong>survival mechanism</strong> is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>It&#x2019;s because sighing can <strong>reset</strong> the lungs. To <strong>reset</strong> is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can <strong>reset</strong> a computer or a phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, that&#x2019;s fine. But how does a sigh <strong>reset</strong> the lungs?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, scientists from UCLA, that&#x2019;s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Thankfully, we don&#x2019;t have to think about this need to <strong>reset </strong>our lungs. Sighing is in fact a <strong>reflex</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Boo!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Argh!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>There &#x2013; you jumped! And that was a fabulous <strong>reflex</strong>, Dan! It&#x2019;s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I meant&#x2026; argh&#x2026; like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> You&#x2019;re welcome.<br> <br> <strong>Dan</strong><br> Do you sigh a lot?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I sigh when I&#x2019;m tired, and I sigh when I&#x2019;m relieved. I <strong>breathe a sigh of relief</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>To breathe a sigh of relief </strong>&#x2013; that&#x2019;s a great expression. It means what you think it means &#x2013; to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That&#x2019;s right. Now, I <strong>breathed a sigh of relief</strong> when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I&#x2019;d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I tend to sigh to show <strong>frustration</strong>. And sometimes <strong>resignation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, <strong>frustration</strong> is what we feel when things aren&#x2019;t going well, when things are annoying us and they don&#x2019;t work. When things are <strong>frustrating</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And <strong>resignation</strong> is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can&#x2019;t change. We feel <strong>resigned</strong> to something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about&#x2026; mice?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster &#x2013; so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let&#x2019;s review today&#x2019;s vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We had the phrase <strong>survival mechanism</strong>. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Next, we had <strong>reset</strong>. You can reset a computer, or a machine &#x2013; to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And you can reset a password &#x2013; this is a little bit different. It means to set &#x2013; or choose - a new password.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>We also had the word <strong>reflex</strong>. This is a physical action or reaction that you can&#x2019;t control. For example&#x2026; Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>There, you closed your eyes. Another <strong>reflex</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we had <strong>to</strong> <strong>breathe a sigh to relief</strong>. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn&#x2019;t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>But we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: <strong>frustration</strong> and <strong>resignation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Frustration</strong> is the state of being <strong>frustrated</strong>. We can say something is <strong>frustrating</strong>. It&#x2019;s <strong>frustrating</strong> when the boss doesn&#x2019;t listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>But let&#x2019;s say you move beyond feeling <strong>frustrated</strong> and start feeling <strong>resigned</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, and that would be when I finally accept the boss will never listen to me. And that&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;ll <strong>resign</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>To <strong>resign</strong> also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that&#x2019;s just another vocabulary example?!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Of course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Which is perfectly average. And that&apos;s it for today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon.</p>
