<p><br><strong>Dan</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Dan and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Hi there, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>You&apos;re a married man, Neil. When you were wed, did your wife change her family name?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes she did.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Was that her choice?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Oh yes. She didn&apos;t like her old name, so for her it was a win-win. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Well, my wife wanted to keep her surname, but was forced to adopt mine because that was the law where we got married.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Would you have thought about taking her name?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>That&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about in this 6 Minute English. A husband taking a wife&apos;s name after marriage. All that, six related words and our quiz question.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK. Let&apos;s have the question.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>In which country has it been forbidden since 1789 for a citizen to change their name legally, even after marriage?</p>
<p>a) Japan<br>b) France<br>c) Turkey</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I&apos;m going to go for b) France</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>And we&apos;ll see if you&apos;re right later. Now, traditionally in the UK, when a man and a woman get married, the woman takes the man&apos;s family name. And this replaces her <strong>maiden name</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>A maiden name is the surname a woman had before she was married. This all dates back to the Norman invasion of England, back in 1066. They introduced the idea that when a woman married a man, she became his property. As a result of this, she took his name.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>These days, many women elect to keep their maiden name upon marriage or combine it with their new husband&apos;s in some way, sometimes by making the name <strong>double-barrelled</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>A double-barrelled name is two names that are connected by a hyphen, such as Jones-Smith.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>However, a growing number of couples in western culture are doing it differently . When they get married, the husband elects to take the wife&apos;s surname.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>In a BBC article about surnames and marriage, Rory Dearlove, formerly Rory Cook, talks about why he decided to take his wife&apos;s surname. He said that he wasn&apos;t really attached to his name anyway. To him it didn&apos;t make any difference.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Well, he&apos;s not alone. A recent study of 2000 UK adults by Opinium, a strategic insight agency, suggested that one in ten millennial men, currently between 18 and 34 years old, fall into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Charlie Shaw, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation instructor, who took his wife&apos;s name when they married last year, said that it was an opportunity to acknowledge the unseen <strong>patriarchal</strong> bias and sexism in our society.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Patriarchal means &apos;controlled by men&apos; and a <strong>bias</strong> is the unfair support or opposition to a person, thing or idea.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Many traditional societies were patriarchal. But modern UK society is less like that. Everyone is meant to be equal.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Ah yes, but that&apos;s the unseen part. And there&apos;s the social view of things too. Rachel Robnett, a researcher at the University of Nevada surveyed a number of people in the US and UK, and found that the husbands of women who keep their maiden names are viewed as &apos;feminine&apos;, while the women are believed to &apos;<strong>wear the trousers</strong>&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>If you &apos;wear the trousers&apos; in a relationship, it means you &apos;have the control and make the decisions for both people&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>I wondered about that, so I went out into London and asked people what they thought about a man who took his wife&apos;s name when they got married. Here&apos;s what they said.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong><br>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a bad idea at all. My dad&apos;s 55 and he took my mother&apos;s surname. If people want to do it, then all the power to them.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong><br>It&apos;s each to their own really. It doesn&apos;t hurt anybody. And it&apos;s no different from a woman taking a man&apos;s name.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong><br>The only reason I think that anybody should take someone else&apos;s surname if just for the creation of a family unit. But if it&apos;s just out of principle, I don&apos;t agree.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>It seems that the people I talked to are comfortable with the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes. Most said that people are free to do what they want. One woman even mentioned the creation of a family <strong>unit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>A unit is a group of people living or working together. A typical family unit would be two parents and some children. Well, that answers that question. People don&apos;t seem to mind who takes who&apos;s name.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Speaking of questions. How about our quiz question?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Oh yes, I asked you in which country it&apos;s been forbidden since 1789 for a citizen to change their name legally, even after marriage?</p>
<p>a) Japan<br>b) France<br>c) Turkey</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And I said b)France</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>And you were spot on as usual, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Let&apos;s take a look at the vocabulary, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>First we had <strong>maiden name</strong>. This is a woman&apos;s family name before she is married. My mother refused to give up her maiden name to my father when she got married.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Then we had <strong>double-barrelled</strong>. A double-barrelled name is two names that are joined by a hyphen. Can you think of any famous examples?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Well, there&apos;s the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla Parker-Bowles for one. She&apos;s married to Prince Charles &#x2013; next in line to the English throne. Then we had <strong>patriarchal</strong>. If something is patriarchal, it is controlled by men. The feminine equivalent is matriarchal, controlled by women.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Then we had <strong>bias</strong>. A bias is unfair support or opposition to a person, thing or idea.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>Many fans are biased in favour of their football team. Then we had <strong>wear the trousers</strong>. If you wear the trousers, you have the control and make the decisions for both people. Do you wear the trousers in your marriage, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Oh, we both wear the trousers in my marriage, thank you Dan. Then we had <strong>unit</strong>. A unit is a group of people living or working together. Like the BBC Learning English team&#x2026; or unit!</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br>And that&apos;s the end of this 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to checkout our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. And we&apos;ll see you next time. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Bye!</p></div>
