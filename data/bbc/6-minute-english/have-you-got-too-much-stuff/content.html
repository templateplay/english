<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Rob. Now, Alice, what did you get up to at the weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>I did some <strong>spring-cleaning</strong>, which means <span>cleaning a place very well, especially places you don&apos;t clean often</span>. So, I was tidying up my wardrobe, trying to organise things&#x2026; and suddenly hundreds of shoes tumbled on my head!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Poor Alice! But why do you have so many shoes? And why do you keep them at the top of your wardrobe? I only have three pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>I like to match my shoes to my outfit &#x2013; and three pairs wouldn&apos;t do the trick. Well, the subject of today&apos;s show is having too much stuff. And you&apos;re making me feel guilty, Rob. You must have too much of something.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, plastic bags. I think they&apos;re useful, but they&apos;re getting <strong>out of hand</strong> &#x2013; and that means not under control. They&apos;re taking over my kitchen!</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>You can recycle plastic bags, you know, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, you can recycle shoes too, you know, Alice!</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, usually I don&apos;t have a lot of <strong>clutter</strong> in my flat &#x2013; and that means an untidy collection of objects. Clutter makes it harder to find the things you need. And it makes moving house a nightmare! All those boxes full of things you don&apos;t need&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Good point. I have a friend who suggested the three buckets system. You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as &apos;to keep&apos;, one as &apos;to get rid of&apos;, one as &apos;maybe to get rid of&apos;. <strong>Get rid of</strong>, by the way, means to remove something you don&apos;t want. It&apos;s the &apos;maybe&apos; bucket that&apos;s tricky, isn&apos;t it? &#x2013; You never know if you might need something in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it would need to be a big bucket too.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, it would.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, l think we could all live better with less. OK, well, let&apos;s have today&apos;s quiz question before we talk more about decluttering our lives: So which word, Alice, means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it&#x2026;<br>a) metaphysics?<br>b) materialism?<br>Or c) existentialism?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>OK&#x2026; I think it&apos;s b) materialism.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, we&apos;ll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now let&apos;s listen to Bea Johnson, author of <em>Zero Waste Home</em> talking about how she and her family have adopted a <strong>minimalist</strong> &#x2013; or deliberately simple &#x2013; lifestyle in their California home.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Bea Johnson, minimalist and author of <em>Zero Waste Home<br></em></strong>We&apos;ve really asked ourselves &apos;what is it that we really need?&apos; We&apos;ve asked really true questions, and evaluated every single thing that we have. There is nothing that we overlooked. I even came to one day look at my vegetable peeler for example and asked myself, &apos;Do I really need that vegetable peeler&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>So one day Bea Johnson decided to <strong>evaluate</strong>, or to judge the importance of something, to see if she needed it.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>She evaluated her vegetable peeler and decided to put it in the &apos;get rid of&apos; bucket!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and to <strong>overlook</strong> something means not to see it. Now, I don&apos;t blame Bea at all because I don&apos;t like peeling vegetables either. And you could actually get the benefit of the vitamins and minerals by eating the skins.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Very healthy, Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>We can really live with fewer things. But some people can&apos;t help looking for the latest version of something or go for designer goods. Writer and journalist James Wallman warns us about this. He wonders how much stuff is too much.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> James Wallman, writer and journalist<br></strong>This thing about need is such a dangerous term because what do you need? And I&apos;m not anti-stuff &#x2013; stuff is good. I&apos;m anti too much stuff and I&apos;m anti the wrong stuff. Don&apos;t go out and buy that labelled good that you think is going to make people think something more of you. That&apos;s not going to make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>James Wallman there. Now, Alice, do you buy labelled goods?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>I&apos;m afraid I do. And <strong>labelled</strong> goods or products are the ones with a famous brand name, like Gucci, Dior, Prada etc. But I do think James Wallman is right &#x2013; buying things just because other people have them, for example, doesn&apos;t make us happy.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yeah, that&apos;s true, but as he says, not everything is the wrong stuff. For example, I&apos;m very fond of my large schoolboy collection of superhero comics. I might not need them, but they make me happy. So what stuff makes you happy, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, well, I like my music CDs and my books &#x2013; even though I&apos;ve got the music on an mp3 player and I don&apos;t often pull a book out from the bookcase.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>They have <strong>sentimental value</strong>, don&apos;t they?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And that means the importance of something because of a personal or emotional feeling that we attach to it. Well, I sold all my music CDs online ages ago.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>That sounds like the sensible thing to do. OK, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I asked you: Which word means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it&#x2026; a) metaphysics, b) materialism or c) existentialism?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>I said b) materialism.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you were right, Alice! Well done! The answer is indeed b) materialism. This is the word used to refer to a desire for material things and wealth and little or no interest in ethical values.<span> </span>Now, can we hear the words we learned today please, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, of course. They are:<br><br>spring-cleaning<br>out of hand<br>clutter<br>get rid of<br>materialism<br>minimalist<br>evaluate<br>overlook<br>labelled<br>sentimental value</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.</p></div>
