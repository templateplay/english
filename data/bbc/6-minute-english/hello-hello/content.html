<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello. I&apos;m Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello. I&apos;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We both started with what is probably the best-known greeting in English and one of the first words English language students learn, and that is &apos;hello&apos;! So today in 6 Minute English we&apos;re digging a little deeper into the world of greetings and the fascinating history of &apos;hello&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Surprisingly, the word &apos;hello&apos; is not as old as you might think. But when did it first appear in print in English?</p>
<p>Was it:</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; in the 1890s<br>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; the 1950s or<br>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; the1820s</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I think English changes really quickly, so I&apos;m going to say b) the 1950s. And we&apos;ll say &apos;hello again&apos; to &apos;hello&apos; a little later in the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>First, greetings. They can be a bit of a <strong>minefield</strong>. A subject full of unpredictable difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>While in many places a handshake or bow is normal &#x2013; there&apos;s also the tricky question of kisses and hugs.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Awkward. Should you kiss? How many times? And should your lips touch their cheek?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, Rob - definitely an <strong>air-kiss</strong>! Close to the cheek, but don&apos;t touch. Much safer.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Greetings are the subject of a new book, by former British diplomat Andy Scott, called One Kiss or Two: In Search of the Perfect Greeting. Here he is on a BBC radio show Word of Mouth. Why are greetings so important?</p>
<p><strong>Andy Scott, author<br></strong>These are the first moments of interaction we have with people. And it&apos;s in those first moments, and using those verbal and physical <strong>rituals</strong> that we have and we can <strong>get in such a</strong> <strong>muddle</strong> about, that we&apos;re kind of recognising each other and reaffirming our <strong>bonds</strong> or even testing our bonds and our relationships with each other, we&apos;re signalling our intentions towards each other, despite the fact we might not necessarily be conscious when we&apos;re doing them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Scott says we need to communicate our intentions to each other and acknowledge our relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s what greetings do. One word he uses to mean &apos;relationship&apos; or &apos;connection&apos; is <strong>bond</strong>. We can reaffirm our <strong>bonds</strong>, which means we confirm them and make them stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we do it through <strong>rituals </strong>-patterns of behaviour that we do for a particular purpose. So there are the phrases such as &apos;hello&apos;, &apos;good afternoon&apos;, &apos;nice to meet you&apos;, and as well as the physical rituals &#x2013; handshakes, bows and kisses.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Though he also said we sometimes want to test our <strong>bonds</strong>. We might want to check if our friendship has grown by offering something warmer than usual &#x2013; like a hug instead of a handshake.</p>
<p>Now, Scott acknowledges how difficult greetings can be &#x2013; using the very British slang phrase &#x2013; <strong>to get in a muddle</strong>. If you <strong>get in a muddle</strong>, you become confused or lost. You might <strong>get in a muddle </strong>if one person expects two kisses and the other expects only one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Though Scott does believe that the details don&apos;t really matter, because another important purpose of greetings is to reduce tension. So if you get it wrong, just laugh about it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, let&apos;s get back to the one word we really shouldn&apos;t <strong>get in a muddle</strong> about, &apos;hello&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let&apos;s listen to Dr Laura Wright, a linguist from Cambridge University, also speaking on the BBC Word of Mouth radio programme. Where does &apos;hello&apos; come from?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Laura Wright, Linguist and BBC presenter<br></strong>It starts as a distant <strong>hailing</strong>: &quot;I see you miles over there and I&apos;ve got to yell at you.&quot; It&apos;s not until the invention of telephones we really get to use hello as a greeting to each other, and even then it wasn&apos;t initially used as a greeting, it was used more as an attention-grabbing device: &quot;You are miles away, the line is about to be cut, I need to attract the attention of the operator as well.&quot; And so everybody would call &apos;hello&apos; to each other as this long-distance greeting form.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Laura says &apos;hello&apos; hasn&apos;t always meant &apos;hello&apos; &#x2013; originally it was just a shout to attract someone&apos;s attention. And we call this kind of shouting <strong>hailing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>The shout would vary in form &#x2013; it could sound like a &apos;hollo&apos;! Or a &apos;hulloa&apos;!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We continued this kind of <strong>hailing</strong> when telephones first appeared. People would keep repeating &apos;hello, hello&apos; while they were waiting to be connected. And before long, this became the actual way to greet somebody on the telephone. Anyway, before we say &apos;goodbye&apos; to &apos;hello&apos; &#x2013; let&apos;s have the answer to today&apos;s question.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I asked when the word first appeared in print in English. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it was in 1826. Other spellings appeared before that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Ah, you see &#x2013; I was thinking English changes really quickly, but not that quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Not that quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So before we go, let&apos;s have a look at today&apos;s vocabulary again. A <strong>minefield</strong> is something that is full of uncertainty and even danger. This sense comes from the literal meaning &#x2013; a field full of explosive landmines!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And then we had <strong>air-kiss</strong> &#x2013; which is when you kiss the air beside someone&apos;s face, instead of the face itself! Like this: mwah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we had <strong>bond</strong> &#x2013; a connection. There&apos;s a close <strong>bond</strong> between us I think, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Which is good, because when I <strong>get in a muddle</strong>, you&apos;re always very understanding!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>To <strong>get in a muddle</strong> means to become confused.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Ritual</strong> was another word &#x2013; <strong>rituals</strong> are certain behaviours that people perform in certain contexts. I have a morning <strong>ritual</strong>, for example: brush my teeth, eat breakfast&#x2026; I didn&apos;t say it was an interesting ritual, Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No, that&apos;s true. Finally, <strong>to hail</strong> &#x2013; it&apos;s to greet someone loudly, especially from a distance. I <strong>hailed</strong> &#xA0;&#xA0;my friend when I saw her at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that&apos;s it for this programme. For more, find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course our website! Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
