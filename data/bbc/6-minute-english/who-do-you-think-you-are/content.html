<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil. So, Alice, what do you see when you look at me?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, male, Caucasian, early 40s, short auburn hair, bushy eyebrows, thin lips...&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. So that&apos;s how you see me? It sounds like a police report, and I&apos;m not sure I like your observation about thin lips. <strong>Caucasian</strong> means white skinned and European, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And today the show is about <strong>identity</strong> &#x2013; who or what a person is. And the way people see us forms part of our sense of identity, while another part comes from our <strong>ethnic</strong> &#x2013; or racial &#x2013; identity. So my question for you today, Neil, is: &#xA0;What percentage of the UK population describe themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it &#x2026;<br>a) 0.9%?<br>b) 5.9%?<br>Or c) 9%?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK&#x2026; I think that it&apos;s a) 0.9%.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now, Neil, you are, of course, many more things than my physical description of you!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m glad to hear that. And it&apos;s true, that until you actually hear somebody speak, there are lots of things you can&apos;t know about them. For example, which country they&apos;re from, what language they speak&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. So looking at me, what would you say, Neil?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I would say Alice that you&apos;re a typical English rose.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Thanks, Neil &#x2013; and <strong>English rose</strong> describes an attractive girl with a pale delicate <strong>complexion</strong> &#x2013; or skin colour &#x2013; but you can&apos;t actually tell where a person is from by the way they look.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I suppose you&apos;re right. I have a friend who also looks very English like you, but she&apos;s a real ethnic mix. Her dad is German and her mum is Brazilian!</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, let&apos;s hear from New York City actress and playwright, Sarah Jones, talking about her complicated ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Sarah Jones, actress and playwright, New York City<br></strong>My family on my dad&apos;s side, my grandparents, are from the South. There&apos;s some Caribbean in there, black Americans from the South and the Caribbean, and then on my mother&apos;s side there are people from the Caribbean, from Ireland but you know Irish American, German American. People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother&apos;s white skin - she&apos;s actually mixed but she&apos;s white from a distance, and I&apos;m black from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sarah Jones there. Well, Sarah has family from all over the world! I suppose the United States - and New York City, especially - is a real melting pot.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>That&apos;s right. And <strong>melting pot</strong> describes a society made from people of different countries who live together and create a new shared culture.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And people think Sarah is <strong>adopted</strong> &#x2013; or raised by parents who aren&apos;t biologically hers &#x2013; because she looks so different to her mum.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>But I expect Sarah sees herself as American. New York is where she was born and raised.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s right. But her grandparents weren&apos;t. Do you think you change when you go and live in another country with people different to you?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, I do. My neighbours are Turkish but they&apos;ve lived in England for 45 years so they&#x2019;ve integrated into our culture. They enjoy English things like&#x2026; our TV soap operas, cooking turkey at Christmas, and drinking tea with milk.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And to <strong>integrate</strong> means to join a group of people, and often involves changing your habits and customs.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. OK. So, Neil, to what extent does the way other people see us, actually change us? Let&apos;s listen to Julian Baggini, a writer and philosopher here in the UK and find out what he thinks.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Julian Baggini, writer and philosopher, UK<br></strong>It seems very evident that our sense of self isn&apos;t something that comes entirely from within. And of course we&apos;re affected by the way other people see us. And that&apos;s one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity. I mean, I think it&apos;s kind of a two-way process that&apos;s ongoing. Our sense of who we are is always a response in part to how other people see us.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So Julian Baggini believes the way other people see us is <strong>formative</strong> in creating our sense of identity &#x2013; or who we are. And formative means important for the development of something.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>So if enough people see you as an English rose, you might start to see yourself as an English rose, even if you aren&apos;t ethnically English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&apos;m not so sure. The friend I talked about earlier, she comes across as much more Brazilian than English in the way she behaves. She doesn&apos;t have the famous English reserve &#x2013; but you&apos;d never know it by looking at her.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And <strong>reserve</strong> means hiding what you&apos;re thinking or feeling. I think I&apos;m guilty of English reserve. How about you, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, I think I <strong>wear my heart on my sleeve</strong>, Alice &#x2013; which means I make my feelings clear. OK, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong>Okey-dokey, fair enough. I asked you: What percentage of the UK population described themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it &#x2026; a) 0.9%, b) 5.9% or c) 9%?<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>I said a) 0.9%.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. And you were on the money today, Neil! Well done! According to a survey conducted by the BBC in 2011, when asked about their own ethnic origins, 0.9% of the UK population said they were mixed race, although it&apos;s thought that the real figure is 2% or more. Now, could you remind us of the words we heard today, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Sure. They are:<br>Caucasian<br>identity<br>ethnic<br>English rose<br>complexion<br>melting pot<br>adopted<br>integrate<br>formative<br>reserve<br>wear your heart on your sleeve&#xA0;</p>
