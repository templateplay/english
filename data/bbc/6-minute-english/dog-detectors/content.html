<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&#x2026;And I&apos;m Neil. We&#x2019;ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Everything ok, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I am so tired. One of my children <strong>is as sick as a dog</strong>. I didn&#x2019;t sleep all night long looking after them.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong><strong>As sick as a dog </strong>is an expression meaning &#x2018;very ill&#x2019;. I&#x2019;m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Don&#x2019;t worry. There&#x2019;s life in this old dog yet.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Good. It&#x2019;s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK&#x2019;s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Amazing. Any success?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Let me ask you in this week&#x2019;s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? &#xA0;Is it&#xA0;</p>
<p>a) 50%</p>
<p>b) 70%</p>
<p>c) 90%</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> I&#x2019;m going to guess a) 50%<br> <br> <strong>Dan<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll find out later if you&#x2019;re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>A wet nose, four <strong>paws,</strong> which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man&#x2019;s best friend? But I&#x2019;ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable? &#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I&#x2019;ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs<br></strong>Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated <strong>bio-sensor</strong>. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been <strong>screened</strong> by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> So, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a <strong>bio-sensor</strong>, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. <br> <strong><br> Neil<br></strong>Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to <strong>screen</strong>, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, there&#x2019;s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they&#x2019;re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Nice. Any more? Maybe around the home?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning &#x2018;a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.&#x2019;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yep. Ex-burglars have often said that they&#x2019;re a much bigger <strong>deterrent</strong>, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh and there&#x2019;s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Exactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can&#x2019;t see them but a dog can still smell them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time <strong>biosensors</strong> then?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I don&#x2019;t know, but here&#x2019;s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary<br> </strong>One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question <strong>orthodoxies</strong>, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>He mentions that this type of research goes against <strong>orthodoxies</strong>, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let&#x2019;s hope so.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes I wouldn&#x2019;t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Oh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?</p>
<p>a) 50%</p>
<p>b) 70%</p>
<p>c) 90%</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said 50%</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>It&#x2019;s a dog&#x2019;s life, Neil. I&#x2019;m sorry. The answer was c) 90%</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Wow! 90%! That&#x2019;s amazing.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Isn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br> <strong>Neil</strong><br> Shall we go through the vocabulary?<br> <br><strong>Dan<br></strong>OK. The first expression we had was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>. If you are <strong>as sick as a dog</strong> it means that you&#x2019;re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>. Next we had <strong>paws</strong>. <strong>Paws</strong> are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, dogs have <strong>paws</strong>. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After <strong>paws</strong>, we had <strong>biosensor</strong>. A <strong>biosensor</strong> is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic. &#xA0;Then we had <strong>screen</strong>. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport &#x2013; where they would <strong>screen</strong> for explosives.&#xA0; How else can it be used, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Well, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will <strong>screen out</strong> those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was <strong>deterrent</strong>. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&#x2019;s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong><br> Good idea!<br> <br> <strong>Neil</strong><br> Finally, we heard <strong>orthodoxies</strong>. An <strong>orthodoxy</strong> is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective is <strong>orthodox</strong> and we often hear its opposite word &#x2013; <strong>unorthodox</strong>, meaning unusual. Do you do anything <strong>unorthodox</strong>, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It&#x2019;s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&#x2019;t blame them! Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
