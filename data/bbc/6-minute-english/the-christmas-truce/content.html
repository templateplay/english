<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, I&apos;m Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m joined today by Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hi Rob! Merry Christmas everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Merry Christmas! Today we&apos;re talking about this celebration. It&apos;s a Christian festival but its message of peace among people is universal.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It&apos;s a pity that today we are far from that - from a moment of absolute peace and <strong>goodwill</strong>. Now, goodwill means a cooperative attitude.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>But there was once a brief moment in history when the human spirit rose above wars.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Ah, you must be talking about the Christmas Truce which happened in World War One, in 1914!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It&apos;s the perfect occasion to talk about it, because this year marks the <strong>centenary</strong> - the 100 year anniversary - of the start of Britain&apos;s involvement in this European conflict. And we&apos;ll look at some related vocabulary during the programme. But, before we go into this extraordinary event, a question about the First World War, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>For me... well... I&apos;m not an expert on the First World War so... we&apos;ll let&apos;s see how I do...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know the answer to this one. It&apos;s about letters. People didn&apos;t have email in the early 20th century so they wrote lots of letters. But do you know how many letters were delivered to the front - the place where the fighting happened - every week? Were there:</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; one million</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; five million or</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; an incredible twelve million letters?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Well, I know there were a lot of people at the front but I&apos;m going to say a) one million.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you&apos;ll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let&apos;s talk about this <strong>unofficial truce</strong> which happened 100 years ago in the Western Front of the First World War.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, so a truce is an agreement between people to stop fighting, with no winner or loser. Now, it&apos;s <strong>unofficial</strong> - which means it&apos;s not authorised by people in a position of authority, in this case, the governments involved in the war. So the soldiers just decided to simply stop fighting. How was this possible, Rob? How did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, soldiers from both <strong>trenches</strong>, all of a sudden, started to <strong>fraternise</strong> - which means they began to meet each other socially.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And the trenches were big holes dug by soldiers from which they attacked the enemy. Living conditions were terrible in these holes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>This truce might have had something to do with the bad conditions in these trenches. Let&apos;s hear what German historian Michael Jurgs has to say about the event. Which expression does he use to describe how the soldiers felt about the war?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Jurgs, author of The Small Peace in the Great War<br></strong>I think it happened because they were all <strong>fed up with</strong> the war. They were promised they would be at home again, Christmas 1914 and after five months of the World War One, there were already a million dead young people, eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old. And at Christmas night the muddy weather became frosty and cold and then from the German trenches, from the German trenches - that sounds unbelievable because always Germans started wars, or joined wars - began the song, &apos;Silent Night, Holy Night&apos;. That was the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>The German historian said the soldiers were fed up with the war - which is an informal way of saying they were bored, or annoyed with it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>The war was continuing and they wished they were home with their families. One night, it was cold and the German soldiers started to sing a song... a carol...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. A carol is a happy song with a religious element - usually a Christmas song. And the carol they sang was (sings a bit of Silent Night).</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>(Joins in the singing) Yes. That&apos;s the carol &apos;Silent Night, Holy Night&apos; and it <strong>broke the ice</strong> between the soldiers. That means it made these men, who didn&apos;t know each other personally, more relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And you know Rob? I really find it fascinating how spontaneous all of this was!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It was indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So how did the authorities respond to this?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>They didn&apos;t like it at all. They banned this sort of fraternising and it didn&apos;t happen again. But not before the soldiers from opposing armies played some football together.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Football?!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. They played a match in <strong>no-man&apos;s-land</strong>! That&apos;s a strip of land between enemy sides over which nobody has control. It was the area between the English trench and the German trench.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>You know, it&apos;s a really nice story, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s quite a touching story, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and very inspiring. Well, our time is almost up so let&apos;s get the right answer to the quiz question. I asked you how many letters were delivered to the front every week. The options were: one million, five million or twelve million.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And I said one million, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And you were a long way off.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. The correct answer is (c) twelve million letters.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Twelve million a week?!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, a week. By the end of the war, two billion letters and 114 million parcels had been delivered to the front.&#xA0; According to statistics, 65 million people around the world fought in this war, which ended in 1918.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That&apos;s really quite incredible Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Some incredible figures there. OK. Let&apos;s remember some of the words we explained today.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>They were:</p>
<p>goodwill</p>
<p>centenary</p>
<p>truce</p>
<p>unofficial</p>
