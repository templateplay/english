<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Neil.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I&apos;m Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>In this programme, we going to hear from someone who smells smells for a living. Although these are very expensive smells - smells that we wear deliberately to make us smell good.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>Ah, you mean scents and perfumes?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes and perfumes are big business. And that is the topic of our quiz in this programme. How much is the perfume industry in the UK worth each year?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA3;650 million</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA3;970 million</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA3;1.3 billion</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, I don&apos;t nose this &#x2013; smell, nose - this is just a guess, but I&#x2019;ll say &#xA3;970 million.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I&#x2019;ll let you know the answer a little later in the programme. Now let&#x2019;s hear from Roja Dove, who is a perfumer. He designs and creates very exclusive and very expensive perfumes. In a recent BBC video he talked about the power of smells. What does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Roja Dove<br></strong>&#x2026;who we are&#xA0;as a personality and the type of smells we like. When we are born, the part of our brain which deals with smell is empty&#xA0;so we learn our response to smell. And then when we smell that <strong>odorant</strong> again it&#x2019;s like a <strong>trigger</strong> or a <strong>catalyst</strong> that will revive the original associational memory.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So Dan, what does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Between our personality and the kind of smells we like. The point he is making is that the smells we experience when we are very young can have a big psychological impact on us even later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I know that feeling &#x2013; smell is a very powerful sense. The smell of something can take you right back in time and fill you with emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Exactly. For example, when I walk through the perfume area of a department store I always feel a bit nostalgic because I can smell the perfume my mum first girlfriend used to wear. It&#x2019;s a powerful sensation.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dove used particular words and expression to describe this, didn&#x2019;t he?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, first he used the word <strong>odorant</strong> to describe the smell. It&#x2019;s not really a common word. We use it more frequently as part of the word <strong><em>de</em></strong><strong>odorant</strong>, which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies. These <strong>odorants</strong>, he said, can act as the <strong>trigger</strong> or <strong>catalyst </strong>for these memories. Both the nouns <strong>trigger</strong> and <strong>catalyst </strong>refer to something that causes a particular response. So a particular smell can be a <strong>trigger</strong> or <strong>catalyst</strong> for a particular emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>As well as being a trigger for memories, smells can, according to Dove, say a lot about your personality. Here he is again talking about the kind of scent to wear if you want to give a particular impression. What does he say these scents make you appear very strong at?</p>
<p><strong>Roja Dove<br></strong>The idea of the message you <strong>give off</strong> with scent I think can&#x2019;t be underestimated. My suggestion would be to look for very, very woody, mossy, structured scents called Chypres if the message you want to put across is that you are someone <strong>not to be messed with</strong>, very, very strong in business, or whatever &#x2013; just <strong>not to be messed with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So what do the scents he described make you seem strong at?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Business, they can make you seem very, very strong in business.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Mmm, and how does he explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, he says that some scents <strong>give off</strong> a particular message. The phrasal verb <strong>give off</strong> is often used to describe something that we broadcast about ourselves without saying anything. So he&#x2019;s saying that our scent, our perfume, can <strong>give off</strong> a message about the kind of person we are and that we shouldn&#x2019;t <strong>underestimate</strong> that. If you <strong>underestimate</strong> something you don&#x2019;t give it as much importance as it should have, you don&#x2019;t take it seriously enough.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>He then goes on to talk about the particular scent that <strong>gives off</strong> the impression of being very strong in business.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, it&#x2019;s a woody, mossy scent which suggests that you are <strong>not someone to be messed with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Not to be messed with</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes &#x2013; someone to be taken seriously, someone who is serious who you don&#x2019;t want to try and trick.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right and talking of tricking &#x2013; did we trick you with the quiz? I asked - What was the value of the perfume industry in the UK?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>And I said it was &#xA3;970 million.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And it was actually option c), which was an incredible &#xA3;1.3 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Wow! That is a lot of smelly stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It is indeed! Right, now, time for vocabulary recap. What words and expressions did we have today?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, first we had <strong>odorant &#x2013; </strong>an unusual word for something that smells.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Then two words with a very similar meaning: a <strong>trigger</strong> and a <strong>catalyst</strong> &#x2013; both of which refer to something that can make something else happen. In this case it was a particular smell making us remember something from the past. So scents can sends us to the past. But they can also say something about our personality.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes, they can send unspoken information -&#xA0; or <strong>give off</strong> messages. And these messages should not be <strong>underestimated</strong>. If you do <strong>underestimate </strong>the importance of smell, it means that you don&#x2019;t take those messages seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And finally we heard the phrase <strong>to mess with someone</strong>. <strong>To mess with someone</strong> means that you don&#x2019;t take them seriously, you cause them trouble and that may cause <em>you</em> trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t want <strong>to mess with</strong> you! Judging by the messages you&#x2019;re <strong>giving off</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah you mean my aftershave? Makes me seem powerful?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>I was thinking more of the egg sandwich you had for lunch. I really wouldn&#x2019;t <strong>underestimate</strong> the power of that.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah! On that note, I think it&#x2019;s time to end the programme. For more, find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Goodbye!</p>
