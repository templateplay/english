<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Welcome to 6 Minute English. In this programme we bring you an expressive topic and six items of vocabulary. I&#x2019;m Neil&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>And I&#x2019;m Tim. So, we had an argument just before we started the show&#x2026;<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We did, Tim. But no hard feelings?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>None. <strong>No hard feelings</strong></span><span> is something you say to somebody you have argued with to say you&#x2019;d still like to be friends. We often fall out over silly things&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x2026; Like who&#x2019;s going to introduce the show&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x2026; Or who&#x2019;s going to choose the quiz question.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>But we understand each other. That&#x2019;s the important thing, isn&apos;t it? <strong>To fall out with somebody</strong></span><span> by the way, is another way of saying to argue or disagree with them. Do you know that you wave your arms around a lot when you&#x2019;re arguing, Tim?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>No, I didn&#x2019;t know I did that.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That isn&#x2019;t very British.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I know. Using <strong>gestures</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or movements you make with your hands or your head to express what you are thinking of feeling &#x2013; is common in some countries but not in others. Then there are some movements &#x2013; like shaking your head &#x2013; which mostly means &#x2018;no&#x2019; but in some countries can mean the opposite.&#xA0;</span><span>&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That&#x2019;s right. In which country does shaking your head mean &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, Tim? Is it&#x2026; <br></span><span>a) Greece,<br></span><span>b) Japan or <br></span><span>c) Bulgaria?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>No idea &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll guess Greece. I do know that in India people shake their heads to mean lots of different things.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>There are plenty of gestures you need to be careful with when you&#x2019;re meeting and greeting people from a culture that&#x2019;s different to your own &#x2013; to avoid offending people &#x2013; or making an awkward faux pas&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>If you make a<strong> faux pas</strong></span><span> it means you say or do something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, our every day use of the thumbs-up signal might offend people from the Middle East.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>to offend</strong></span><span> means to make somebody angry or upset.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Let&#x2019;s hear now from Business Professor Erin Meyer talking about how easy it is to misunderstand why people behave the way they do in everyday situations when we don&#x2019;t belong to the same culture.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Erin Meyer, Business Professor in Dubai<br></span></strong><span>A while ago I was in Dubai and one of my students, my Emirati students, was driving me home after a session and the car stopped at a light and she rolled down the window, and she started shouting at someone outside of the window. This guy was crossing the street with a big box of cloth. And he started shouting back, and she opened up the door, and they started gesticulating and shouting at one another. And I thought, wow, they&#x2019;re having a huge fight, I thought maybe he was going to hit her. And she got back in the car, and I said, well, what were you fighting about? And she said, &#x2018;Oh no, no, we weren&#x2019;t fighting, he was giving me directions to your hotel.&#x2019; And I thought that was a great example of how someone from another culture may misperceive or misunderstand something as a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span><strong>Gesticulating</strong> &#x2013; what does that mean?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>It means what I was doing earlier! &#x2013; Waving your arms around to express what you&#x2019;re feeling.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Erin Meyer was worried because her student and the man on the street were shouting and gesticulating at each other. She thought they were having a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>expressive </strong></span><span>means showing what you think or feel.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>You were nodding in agreement, there, Tim. Which reminds me of our quiz question. In which country does shaking your head mean &#x2018;yes&#x2019;? Is it&#x2026; a) Greece, b) Japan or c) Bulgaria?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I said Greece&#x2026;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And that&#x2019;s the wrong answer, I&#x2019;m afraid. The right answer is Bulgaria. In some Southeastern European areas such as Bulgaria and southern Albania, shaking your head is used to indicate &quot;yes&quot;. In those regions, nodding in fact means &quot;no&quot; as well.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I hope I remember that the next time I meet somebody from Southeastern Europe.</span><span>OK, shall we look back at the words we learned today?</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x2018;No hard feelings&#x2019; is something you say to somebody you have argued with or beaten in a game or contest to say you&#x2019;d still like to be friends.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>For example, &#x201C;I always get the quiz questions right &#x2013; unlike you Neil. But no hard feelings, OK?&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That&#x2019;s not a very realistic example, Tim&#x2026; But I&#x2019;ll let it go. Number two &#x2013; &#x2018;to fall out with somebody&#x2019; means to argue or disagree with them.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;I fell out with my best friend at school. We didn&#x2019;t talk to each other for a whole week!&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That must&#x2019;ve been a serious disagreement, Tim! What were you arguing about?<br><br></span><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>I can&#x2019;t remember. It was a long time ago. Number three &#x2013; a &#x2018;gesture&#x2019; is a movement you make with your hands or head to express what you are thinking or feeling.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;She opened her arms wide in a gesture of welcome.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Or the verb &#x2013; &#x201C;I gestured to Neil that we only had one minute left to finish the show!&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Is that true, Tim? You&#x2019;re nodding your head &#x2013; but we should also quickly mention &#x2018;gesticulate&#x2019; which means to make gestures with your hands or arms!&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>A &#x2018;faux pas&#x2019; is saying or doing something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, &#x201C;I committed a serious faux pas at a party last night &#x2013; that I&#x2019;m too embarrassed to tell you about!&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Oh dear, Tim. I hope you didn&#x2019;t offend too many people &#x2013; &#x2018;offend&#x2019; is our next word &#x2013; and it means to make somebody angry or upset.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Well, you&#x2019;ve given us a good example already, Neil, so let&#x2019;s move on to the final word &#x2013; &#x2018;expressive&#x2019; &#x2013; which means showing what you think or feel.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>&#x201C;Tim has a very expressive face.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Thanks! Another quick example &#x2013; &#x201C;I waved my hand expressively to signal to Neil that it was time to finish the show.&#x201D;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Taking my cue from Tim, that&#x2019;s all for today. But please remember to check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.&#xA0;</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim<br></span></strong><span>Bye-bye!</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Goodbye!</p></div>
