<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we introduce a colourful topic and six suitable items of vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>I&#x2019;m Tim&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&#x2019;m Neil. Why are you wearing a policeman&#x2019;s hat, Tim?</p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>To get me in the mood for our topic today &#x2013; uniforms!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, the hat certainly suits you!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>And if something <strong>suits you</strong> it looks good on you! Well, thanks, Neil. And funnily enough, I have a question for you on the subject of police hats! In the 19th century, police officers&apos; top hats could be used&#x2026;<br><br>a) to stand on,<br>b) as a weapon or<br>c) to protect their heads from the sun?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, they&apos;re kind of pointy so I&#x2019;m going to say as a weapon.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>OK. Let&#x2019;s consider what the point of a uniform is. Why do some jobs have them while others don&#x2019;t?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Well &#x2013; The police, and other emergency services, like the fire brigade, and ambulance service &#x2013; they need practical clothes to help them do their job.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>People need to recognize them too, don&#x2019;t they?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah, that&#x2019;s right. A uniform makes people stand out from crowd.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>If something <strong>stands out</strong> it&#x2019;s noticeable or easy to see.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But uniform also allows you <strong>to</strong> <strong>fit in</strong> &#x2013; it shows you belong to a particular group or organization &#x2013; and people often enjoy that sense of community at work.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Do you think we should get some 6 Minute English T-shirts made, Neil?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we share a sense of community without team T-shirts, Tim. Let&#x2019;s listen to cultural historian, Joe Moran, talking about why wearing a uniform can also allow you to behave differently to the way you normally behave.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Joe Moran, cultural historian<br></strong>It&#x2019;s a role and a genre that you adopt and it&#x2019;s kind of &#x2013; it&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s not quite you. It&#x2019;s kind of a persona that you can put on. In Germany they call it &#x2018;maskenfreiheit&#x2019;, which is the freedom conferred by masks. There&#x2019;s something about taking on what is very clearly a persona or professional role, that can be liberating, I think.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So when you put on a uniform you are adopting a role or genre. <strong>Genre</strong> means a particular style. And a <strong>persona</strong> is a character you present to the outside world &#x2013; as opposed to the person you feel like inside.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Joe Moran compares putting on a persona to putting on a mask. And he says this can be very <strong>liberating</strong>. But do you really think putting on a uniform liberates &#x2013; or frees &#x2013; us from the person we really are?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Maybe. If you&#x2019;re shy, for example, a uniform might feel liberating because it allows you to behave more confidently. So, if you could choose a uniform and a new persona, what would it be, Tim?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Hmm. An airline pilot, I think. I&#x2019;d look great in a blazer with brass buttons &#x2013; and with the cap and mirror sunglasses. Hello, this is your captain speaking. We&#x2019;ll shortly be arriving at LAX airport in sunny Los Angeles. Local time is 12.55 and it&#x2019;s hot hot hot outside, so I hope you&#x2019;ve packed plenty of sun cream.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK Tim, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! I can see you&#x2019;d love being a pilot &#x2013; or at least you&#x2019;d love talking to your passengers!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>What about you, Neil? What would you like to try on for size? A surgeon&#x2019;s scrubs? A nun&#x2019;s habit?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>To try something on for size</strong> means to decide whether it&#x2019;s what you want or not. No Tim&#x2026; I&#x2019;d go for a chef&#x2019;s apron, checked trousers, a tall hat.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>I think the uniform would suit you, but are you good at cooking, Neil?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&#x2019;m an excellent cook. Now, I think we should have the answer to today&#x2019;s quiz question, Tim.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Yes, I asked what a police officer&#x2019;s hat could be used for in the 19th century.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said as a weapon.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Wrong, I&#x2019;m afraid. From 1829 to 1839, Metropolitan Police officers wore a cane-reinforced top hat, which could be used as a step to climb or see over walls. I wonder if modern police hats are strong enough to stand on?<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We&#x2019;ll try yours later and find out. But now let&#x2019;s go over the other key words we learned today.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>OK. If something &#x2018;suits you&#x2019;, it looks good on you. For example, &#x201C;Does this pilot&#x2019;s uniform suit me, Neil?&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>It suits you down to the ground, Tim! And that means it suits you very well!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Number two &#x2013; If something &#x2018;stands out&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s noticeable or easy to see.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&#x201C;My colourful suit really stood out at the party.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>In a good way, I hope! OK, next item &#x2013; &#x2018;to fit in&#x2019; &#x2013; means you belong to a particular group and are accepted by them.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>&#x201C;I never fitted in with the cool kids at school.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that, Tim! Maybe you weren&#x2019;t wearing the right uniform? Number four is &#x2018;persona&#x2019; &#x2013; the character you present to the outside world &#x2013; as opposed to the person you feel like inside.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>&#x201C;My work persona is confident and chatty but I&#x2019;m actually rather shy.&#x201D;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I&#x2019;m learning a lot about you today, Tim!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>They&#x2019;re just examples, Neil. I don&#x2019;t have a work persona &#x2013; that&#x2019;s the nice thing about our job &#x2013; there&#x2019;s no need to put on masks or personas.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Just the occasional hat&#x2026;<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>Indeed. And a very nice hat this is too &#x2013; I think I&#x2019;ll keep it. Now, let&#x2019;s finish the vocabulary! Number five &#x2013; &#x2018;liberating&#x2019; means feeling you can behave however you like.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>For example, &#x201C;Talking openly about your problems can be very liberating.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Tim<br></strong>And finally, &#x2018;to try something on for size&#x2019; means to test something to decide whether you want it or not.<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Our listeners can try these new vocabulary items on for size and decide whether they&#x2019;ll be useful or not!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Tim<br></strong>And if not, then please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us what you think!<span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Goodbye!<br> <br> <strong>Tim<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>
