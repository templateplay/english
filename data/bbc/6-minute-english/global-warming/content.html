<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I&apos;m Neil. I&apos;m feeling a bit chilly today, Alice. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, it is <strong>unseasonably</strong></span><span> cold today &#x2013; which means not normal for the time of year. But the weather is very unpredictable these days. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I know what you mean. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, global warming is the subject of today&apos;s show. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Is global warming really something to worry about? Some people say that the Earth has warmed up in the past and nothing terrible has happened. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>The Earth has warmed up before, but this was the result of things like wobbles in the Earth&apos;s orbit, not because of an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Can we reverse the changes? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>No, it&apos;s too late, and now we have to find ways to adapt to extreme weather, rising sea levels, and melting polar ice caps. However, we can <strong>mitigate</strong></span><span> greenhouse gas emissions &#x2013; or make them less harmful. But before we talk more about this, I have a question for you. How much has the average temperature of the Earth&apos;s surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) 0.85&#xB0;C?<br></span><span>b) 1.85&#xB0;C?<br></span><span>Or c) 8.5&#xB0;C?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I&apos;m gonna go for the big one a) 8.5&#xB0;C.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you got the answer right later on, Neil. But first, do you know any ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I do, actually. An Argentinian company has started collecting cow&#x2026; emissions and converting them into usable energy.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Well, as the world eats more meat, methane emissions from livestock are actually becoming a bigger climate concern.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And one day&apos;s worth of cow emissions provides energy to run a car for 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>OK, moving on now, so the world is going to have to adapt to global warming since we can&apos;t turn back the clock on climate change. And rich countries have the resources to do this, whilst poorer countries don&apos;t. Let&apos;s hear from Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, talking about how this problem is being addressed.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh<br></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq: The rich countries have already pledged and promised a hundred billion dollars a year, starting from 2020, to cover all kinds of climate change activities which in climate change are either going to be called mitigation or adaptation.<br></span><span>Owen Bennett Jones: A year? But that&apos;s an enormous sum of money!<br></span><span>Saleemul Huq: Not that enormous compared to what they gave to the banking system when it collapsed. Climate change is a much bigger problem than the banking crisis.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq interviewed on the BBC World Service programme Newshour Extra. Well, he says rich countries have <strong>pledged</strong></span><span> &#x2013; or promised &#x2013; to deliver a hundred billion dollars a year to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. However, he suggests that this sum could have been larger &#x2013; since more money than this was donated to resolve the banking crisis.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>For example, after the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, New York City invested ten billion dollars on storm defences to protect Manhattan &#x2013; and Wall Street. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And where lack of water is a problem, countries like Australia, China, and Spain, have built <strong>desalination</strong></span><span> plants, which remove the salt from seawater to produce drinking water. But it&apos;s too expensive for developing countries to do this, even though they need them. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>So in relative terms, one billion dollars a year to help poor countries is a small sum of money when compared to their need. Countries like Bangladesh have developed <strong>homegrown</strong></span><span> technologies &#x2013; which means produced locally &#x2013; such as harvesting rainwater from their rooftops. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, Alice, and thinking about certain radical proposals for adaptation &#x2013; did you know there&apos;s a Dutch company that wants to build floating cities for us to live in? </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>No, I didn&apos;t.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yeah. Plans include 15-storey high-rise buildings and floating food production. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>It sounds like it would be incredibly expensive. Has anyone actually built one?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>No, not so far. Let&apos;s hear from <span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London,</span></span><span> talking about why this might be.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London<br></span></strong><span>Remember, we&apos;re going to have 9.5 billion people by the middle of this century. Now, if you think about it, think about the logistics of building a city, floating, for say, ten million people. And then multiply that up to 60 per cent of 9.5 billion people. OK? So don&apos;t think it&apos;s really cost-efficient.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So in practical terms, the logistics of building a large floating city probably couldn&apos;t work. It wouldn&apos;t be <strong>cost-efficient </strong></span><span>&#x2013; or good value for the money you paid. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>logistics</strong></span><span> means the organization of a complex activity.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>On the other hand, the logistics of teaching farmers in Bangladesh to breed ducks instead of chickens, for example, would be relatively simple and cost-efficient &#x2013; and since ducks float and chickens don&apos;t, it&apos;s a sensible adaptation to climate change! </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s a great example, Neil! Now, I think it&apos;s time for the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked: How much has the average temperature of the Earth&apos;s surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it&#x2026; a) 0.85&#xB0;C, b) 1.85&#xB0;C or c) 8.5&#xB0;C?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And I said c) 8.5&#xB0;C and I know I&apos;m wrong.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>Yes, I&apos;m afraid you are Neil. The right answer is actually 0.85&#xB0;C. And did you know that 13 of the 14 warmest years were recorded in the 21st Century?</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I did not know that, Alice. But I do know which words we learned today.<br></span><span>They are:<br></span><span>unseasonably<br></span><span>mitigate<br></span><span>pledged<br></span><span>desalination<br></span><span>homegrown<br></span><span>cost-efficient<br></span><span>logistics</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br></span></strong><span>And that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Both<br></span><span> </span></strong><span>Bye!</span><span><br></span></p></div>
