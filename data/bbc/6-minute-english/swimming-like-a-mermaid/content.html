<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you some useful items vocabulary. I&apos;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Now Neil, I know you&apos;re a keen swimmer.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I am. I try to get to the pool once a week and do a few lengths, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s good to hear because swimming is one of the best sports for keeping fit. It&apos;s an aerobic exercise &#x2013; <strong>aerobic</strong> means a very active type of exercise that makes your heart and lungs stronger. The opposite of this is anaerobic &#x2013; and for my question today Neil, I wonder if you know which of these activities is an example of anaerobic exercise?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; weightlifting</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; kickboxing</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; dancing</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&apos;t have a clue but I&apos;ll pick my favourite sport &#x2013; a) weightlifting.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Is that really your favourite sport?! Anyway, we&apos;ll find out the answer at the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So what about you Rob &#x2013; do you visit the swimming pool very often?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Only to use the cafe! I don&apos;t like anything <strong>aquatic</strong> &#x2013; I mean connected to water. I just don&apos;t like getting wet - and swimming up and down a pool is just boring!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well there are alternatives to plain swimming. There&apos;s <strong>synchronised</strong> swimming&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Synchronised &#x2013; that&apos;s moving together at the same time or speed as someone else. Like dancing in water I suppose? Hmm, I&apos;m not a good dancer either.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>How about the new craze of &apos;mermaiding&apos; which is making a splash at the moment &#x2013; in other words becoming very popular. The idea originated in America but is now popular in the UK and Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Tell me more!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Let&apos;s hear from an expert &#x2013; Emma Longden, who&apos;s founder of Fin2Fit &#x2013; which runs classes, teaching the skills of swimming safely like a mermaid&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br></strong>Mermaiding is putting a monofin on your feet. Putting a beautiful tail on and getting in the water and swimming like a mermaid.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, so I would need to wear a monofin &#x2013; the prefix &apos;<strong>mono</strong>&apos; means &apos;only one or single&apos; &#x2013; so a single fin &#x2013;that&apos;s &#xA0;like a mermaid&apos;s tail - then I just get in the water and swim like a mermaid &#x2013; I&apos;m not so sure about that Neil &#x2013; I don&apos;t really know how mermaids swim!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>There&apos;s more to it than that Rob. It&apos;s actually good for your fitness as Emma can explain&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br></strong>It gives children&apos;s confidence in water a boost, it improves their water strength, it gives you an entire body workout. It works your cardiovascular system, it works your legs, your core &#x2013; it improves the children&apos;s swimming technique, flexibility, balance, co-ordination &#x2013; you get the reward, you get the social aspect &#x2013; and alongside all of that, they&apos;re learning vital life skills along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So there are many benefits to mermaiding Rob. Improving confidence, strength, technique and it&apos;s good for your cardiovascular system &#x2013; <strong>cardiovascular</strong> relates to your heart and blood vessels.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I like the sound of the <strong>social</strong> aspect &#x2013; and by that Emma means being with other people and having fun. It&apos;s an activity that&apos;s sociable. &#xA0;And it teaches life skills &#x2013; useful skills that help you deal with everyday challenges. Well that&apos;s great for kids &#x2013; and that&apos;s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>What&apos;s that?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Mermaiding is for kids &#x2013; so I can&apos;t get involved &#x2013; even if I wanted to&#x2026; can I?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>You can Rob. According to Emma, it&apos;s growing in popularity with adults too &#x2013; any excuse to live out your fantasies hey!</p>
<p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br></strong>There are so many adults that actually kind of want to live out their childhood dreams that they wanted to be a mermaid when they were children and they didn&apos;t get the opportunity and now it&apos;s here and now it&apos;s available and... So yes, we do a lot of adult classes as well.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>There you go Rob &#x2013; living out your childhood dreams &#x2013; that doing things you wanted to do when you were a child. Like being a mermaid!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Sorry Neil, that wasn&apos;t a dream for me &#x2013; although I did dream of swimming like a shark once! Anyway, mermaiding is a good form of aerobic exercise &#x2013; but earlier I asked you what an example of anaerobic exercise is. Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; weightlifting</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; kickboxing</p>
<p>c) &#xA0; &#xA0;dancing</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I said weightlifting. Was I right?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>You were Neil, well done. Any exercise that consists of short exertion, high-intensity movement is an anaerobic exercise &#x2013; such as weight lifting, sprinting and jumping. I won&apos;t go into scientific detail &#x2013; but aerobics exercise is done over a longer period of time and strengthens the heart and lungs, thereby improving the body&apos;s utilisation of oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks for that Rob. Now I think we should sprint through our recap of some of the words we&apos;ve talked about today &#x2013; starting with &apos;<strong>aerobic&apos;</strong>, which you just explained. &quot;Mermaiding is a good aerobic workout.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Assuming you don&apos;t mind dressing up! Next we had &apos;<strong>aquatic&apos;</strong> which refers to something connected with water. &quot;Synchronised swimming is an example of an aquatic sport.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, you slipped in another of our words there &#x2013; &apos;<strong>synchronised&apos;</strong> &#x2013; which means &apos;moving together at the same time or speed as someone or something else&apos;. &quot;We synchronised our watches so that we all arrived at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Good idea &#x2013; you&apos;re always late Neil. Then we mentioned &apos;<strong>mono&apos;</strong> which means &apos;one&apos; or &apos;single&apos; and is used as a prefix on words such as &apos;monochrome&apos; &#x2013; one colour &#x2013; or &apos;monorail&apos; &#x2013; a train running on a single track.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Then we heard the word &apos;<strong>cardiovascular&apos; - </strong>&#xA0;a word that relates to the effect on your heart and lungs. &quot;Experts say those who quit smoking could also quickly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Finally, we also mentioned &apos;<strong>social&apos;</strong> &#x2013; this adjective relates to activities that you do with other people and are usually fun. &quot;Now I live in London, I have a great social life.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well you never invite me out Rob!&#xA0; Anyway, that&apos;s it for this edition of 6 Minute English. Before you rush off to fulfil your dream of being a mermaid, don&apos;t forget to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes and that&apos;s at bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Goodbye</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>Goodbye.</p></div>
