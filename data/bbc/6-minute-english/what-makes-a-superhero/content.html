<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I&apos;m Rob... and... is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&apos;s Super-Finn!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Hello Rob - it&apos;s just Finn here actually - I&apos;m no <strong>superhero</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>That&apos;s a shame. So you don&apos;t have any special <strong>superpowers </strong>- amazing skills and abilities that can be used for saving people and fighting against evil?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, lots of powers, but no superpowers. I&apos;m afraid not. Superheroes, of course, tend to be <strong>fictional</strong> characters &#x2013; they&apos;re made-up characters, who appear in comics and books and movies.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>You mean characters like Batman, Spiderman and Wonder Woman. Do you have a favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>I do actually. Spiderman was my favourite when I was growing up. And he can climb up walls and I really wanted to do the same - I tried to climb up the walls in my house and sadly I failed because superheroes are fictional - they aren&apos;t real!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well some real-life superheroes do exist and that&apos;s what we&apos;ll be talking about today and we&apos;ll be explaining some words related to superheroes. But first a question...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Can I use my superpowers to answer this one?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>You can try. What year did Superman first appear published in a comic book?</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1930</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1934</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1938</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>My <em>spidey</em> sense tells me it&apos;s 1934.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>I&apos;ll tell you if you&apos;re right or wrong at the end of the programme. Now let&apos;s find out more about some real-life superheroes. These are people who don&apos;t really have superpowers but they are doing something <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>So they are doing something special - but most importantly, they are doing something good.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>People often describe someone who has done something brave, such as saving someone&apos;s life, as a hero. Firefighters are sometimes described as heroes because they often risk their lives to save others.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>But heroes don&apos;t have to be <strong>life-savers</strong>. We sometimes describe a person with great intelligence or amazing abilities as &apos;our hero&apos; - a musician maybe or an athlete. It&apos;s someone we <strong>admire</strong> and look up to.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well there&apos;s a man in Japan who&apos;s recently been described as a &apos;superhero&apos;. To be honest, I don&apos;t think his powers are superhuman - that means a power that ordinary humans don&apos;t have - but what he does is rather unusual and he gives up his free time doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Tell me more Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>This is Chibatman - named after the city of Chiba where he comes from. His <strong>mission</strong> - his purpose - is to make the people of the city happy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That&apos;s a worthwhile mission.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>It is. Chibatman has been spotted &apos;flying&apos; through the streets of Chiba dressed a bit like Batman and riding his custom-built three-wheeled Chibatpod. But why? Is he just a bit crazy or does he have <strong>honourable</strong> intentions?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>You mean does he genuinely want to do good things and make things better?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well, listen to what he says, speaking through a translator, and see if you can hear what his reasons are &#x2026; &#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br clear="none">&apos;Chibatman&apos; - Chiba superhero<br clear="none"></strong>I started doing this around three years ago. As for my reasons: during the great earthquake people forgot how to smile. I wanted to help bring the smile back and that&apos;s why I started.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>OK, so because of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, he felt people had forgotten how to smile. So his mission was to get people smiling again. That&apos;s something we could describe as being &apos;honourable&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>What is interesting about him and other superheroes is they keep their identity <strong>closely-guarded</strong> - nobody knows who the real man in the costume is.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That&apos;s also true for another Japanese man who&apos;s been called a superhero. Mr Full Moon wears a costume to hide his identity when he goes around cleaning the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, he actually talks to people through a voice on his smartphone. He hasn&apos;t been employed by anyone to do this &#xAD;- he just claims he wants to keep the city&apos;s streets cleaner. We could call him a grime fighter armed with a dustpan and brush!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Very good - a &apos;grime fighter&apos; - someone fighting dirt and dust!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Anyway, time now to see if your superpowers helped you answer today&apos;s question correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes Rob, you asked me what year Superman first appeared in a comic book.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>And you said 1934 and you were wrong. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and originally he wasn&apos;t a hero but a villain - the bad guy - but he was changed into a hero before he was published in the comic.</p>
<p>Now before you change into your costume, could you save the day by reminding us of some of the words we have heard today?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, today we heard:</p>
<p>superhero</p>
<p>superpowers</p>
<p>fictional</p>
<p>extraordinary</p>
<p>life-savers</p>
<p>admire</p>
<p>mission</p>
<p>honourable</p>
<p>closely-guarded</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none"></strong>Well, that brings us to the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. We hope you&apos;ve enjoyed today&#x2019;s programme. Please join us again soon. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Bye.</p></div>
