<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English&#x2013; the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I&apos;m Dan&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I&apos;m Catherine. In this programme we&apos;ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course<em>&#x2026;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>How would you like to be a mermaid?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it&apos;s all a myth.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, then you&apos;ll find this week&apos;s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I suppose I will. Go on then.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>When did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Ok, and by <strong>alleged, </strong>you mean &apos;said or believed to be true but not proven&apos;. I don&apos;t believe in mermaids, but I think there&apos;s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you&apos;re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, a mermaid is a creature that&apos;s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, &apos;The Little Mermaid&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>There you go! There&apos;s no real evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You&apos;re telling me fish tales, Dan</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Ok. I&apos;ll confess. They aren&apos;t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist-high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it&apos;s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Daniel Craig, merman<br></strong>A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I <strong>stumbled across</strong> the mermaiding community merely by accident.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So it&apos;s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he <strong>stumbled across</strong> it, or &apos;found it by accident&apos;. So, it doesn&apos;t really count then though, does it Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>A real, real mermaid? <strong>That&apos;s a different</strong> <strong>kettle of fish</strong>, which is an idiomatic phrase that means &apos;a completely different matter or issue&apos;. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hang on now, that rings a bell! That&apos;s in Israel, isn&apos;t it? And it <strong>allegedly</strong> appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>There you go then!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a <strong>hoax,</strong> which means &apos;a deception or lie &#x2013; often done for humour or sometimes cruelty&apos;. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Daniel Craig, merman<br></strong>It&apos;s just <strong>serene</strong>. It&apos;s the perfect place for a temporary <strong>getaway</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So he likes it because it&apos;s <strong>serene</strong>, which means &apos;calm and peaceful&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Yes and he says it&apos;s the perfect <strong>getaway</strong>, which is &apos;a place you go in order to escape from normal life&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I still don&apos;t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I said I think it was the 2000s</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>You&apos;re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let&apos;s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was <strong>alleged</strong>. If something is <strong>alleged</strong> it is &apos;said or believed be true but not proven to be true&apos;. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there&apos;s no proof. And our next one was <strong>stumbled across</strong>. So, if you <strong>stumble across </strong>something you &apos;encounter or find it by accident&apos;. It&apos;s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever <strong>stumbled across</strong> anything unusual?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I <strong>stumbled across</strong> a map of London. It got me straight to the party.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Spooky.</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>The next one after that was <strong>a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish </strong>is an idiomatic phrase which means &apos;a completely different matter or issue&apos;. You could also use the phrase &apos;a horse of a different colour&apos;.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Next up, we had <strong>hoax</strong>. And a <strong>hoax</strong> is &apos;a deception or lie &#x2013; which is often done for humour or cruelty&apos;. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br></strong>One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard <strong>serene</strong>. <strong>Serene</strong> means &apos;calm and peaceful&apos;. The noun is serenity. What&apos;s your idea of serene, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a<strong> getaway. </strong>A<strong> getaway</strong> is an informal word meaning &apos;a place you go in order to escape from normal life&apos;, such as a holiday. So, where&apos;s your favourite getaway, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Dan<br> </strong>My favourite <strong>getaway </strong>is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p>
