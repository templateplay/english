<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Sophie&#x2026;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I&apos;m Neil. So, Sophie I watched Snow White and the Huntsma</span><span>n on TV last night.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Oh, you mean the modern retelling of the story Snow White<em>?</em> Did you enjoy it, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>It was OK. But the seven dwarves were no fun. I prefer the original Disney cartoon version.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Don&apos;t be silly, Neil. Walt Disney didn&apos;t invent the story. The movie you watched is a <strong>remake</strong>, a film that has been made again, but the fairy tale is very old.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, that may be true, but I still prefer the Disney version with funny dwarves. In the new version, even the names of the dwarves are different and, you know, serious looking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>But this new version is for young adults &#x2013; it&apos;s a different <strong>genre</strong> &#x2013; or style &#x2013; of film. Names like Sneezy, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy are too childish. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hmm. What&apos;s wrong with childish?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>It&apos;s right up your street, isn&apos;t it Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Too right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Anyway, fairy tales are the subject of today&apos;s show, and I have a question for you: which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a 2014 film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it&#x2026;<br></span><span>a) Cate Blanchett?<br></span><span>b) Angelina Jolie?<br></span><span>Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, I&apos;ll go for a) Cate Blanchett. She often plays evil characters. I can&apos;t forget her in the 2008 movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Well, we&apos;ll find out if you chose the right move star later on in the programme. But to return to the idea of childish fairy stories, let&apos;s listen to Diane Purkiss, a children&apos;s author, talking about how originally fairy tales were intended for an adult audience.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br>Diane Purkiss, children&apos;s author<br></span></strong><span>Interestingly there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult, or at any rate a young adult &#x2013; a dark sort of genre. And that&apos;s natural because actually in the past fairy tales were told by adults to adults in William Shakespeare&apos;s time. It&apos;s only in the Victorian era that they become moral children&apos;s tales and it looks like we&apos;re going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Diane Purkiss. So these Hollywood remakes aimed at the teen market are actually returning fairy tales to an adult audience. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>That&apos;s right, Neil. And <strong>dark</strong> here means scary or frightening. The Victorians <strong>toned down</strong> this dark content &#x2013; or made it less forceful. They also introduced a <strong>moral</strong> &#x2013; or message about what&apos;s right and wrong &#x2013; to the tales.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>inception</strong> means the beginning. So fairy tales began as a dark genre.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Can you give us some examples of dark stories written by the brothers Grimm, Neil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well&#x2026; I have a list here. Let&apos;s see. In The Frog Prince the princess doesn&apos;t kiss the frog, she throws it&#x2026; she throws it against the wall! Hmm, yes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Hmm. I prefer the kiss version.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And in Little Red Riding Hood don&apos;t believe that version where the wolf shuts granny in a cupboard. In the real version he gobbles her up and then eats Red Riding Hood for dessert.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Charming. And to <strong>gobble something up</strong> means to eat it very fast. OK, that&apos;s enough. Let&apos;s move on. Did you know that some of the stories &#x2013; like Beauty and the Beast, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Snow White go back much further than the earliest written stories &#x2013; even the ones in Latin and Greek?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>No, I didn&apos;t. To be honest, Sophie, I thought Walt Disney had written them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Oh Neil&#x2026; well research suggests that some fairy tales date back to well before the brothers Grimm and even Shakespeare. Let&apos;s hear more from Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University in the UK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br>Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University<br></span></strong><span><strong>Dr JTehrani:</strong> So these fairy tales that we&apos;ve looked at &#x2013; we&apos;ve been able to trace back, really,&#xA0;thousands of years &#x2013; probably sort of 4-6,000 years is the origin of many famous European folk tales, stories such as Beauty and the Beast.<br></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> What, 6,000 years?!<br></span><span><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. <br></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> Good heavens!<br><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> We&apos;ve been able to trace the transmission across generations of these stories much further back than is generally recognized.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>But Sophie &#x2013; if there&apos;s no written evidence of the stories from 6,000 years ago how does Dr Tehrani, who we&apos;ve just heard from, know people were telling them?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>Well, dating languages isn&apos;t something I&apos;m familiar with &#x2013; I think it&apos;s a bit like looking at a few dinosaur bones and trying to reconstruct what dinosaurs looked like. But here you&apos;re trying to reconstruct stories without any actual bits. It must have been hard work for the researchers. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, I think it&apos;s time to hear the quiz question again, Sophie.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>OK, I asked: Which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it&#x2026; a) Cate Blanchett? b) Angelina Jolie? Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I said Cate Blanchett.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>And you were wrong. Angelina Jolie played the main character in the film Maleficent. Cate Blanchett played the elf queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings. And Meryl Streep played a blue-haired witch in the 2014 film Into the Woods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now, can we hear those words again?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br></span></strong><span>OK!<br></span><span>remake<br></span><span>genre <br></span><span>dark<br></span><span>toned down<br></span><span>moral<br></span><span>inception<br></span><span>gobble up</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s spellbinding 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.</span></p></div>
