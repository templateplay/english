<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And hello, I&apos;m Neil. And Rob, I have to say, I am very very excited!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Why&apos;s that, Neil? Are you going on holiday?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Come on, Rob. You know why. The 2018 World Cup is about to start in Russia. Four weeks of <strong>world-class</strong> football to watch. By <strong>world-class</strong> I mean &apos;some of the best in the world&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, yes, I know that. But to be honest, I&apos;ll just be taking a passing interest &#x2013; I&apos;ve got better things to do!</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Better things to do? Well, I&apos;m going to be glued to my TV to watch the 32 countries compete for the title of World Cup Champions. And if you love football&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>&#x2026;or not&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>&#x2026; we&apos;ve got some useful vocabulary to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>But let&apos;s start with a question for you to answer, Neil, to see how much you really know. Now, the mascot for Russia 2018 is a wolf called Zabivaka. What does his name mean in English? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) The winner<br>b) The one who scores or<br>c) Fair play</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, my Russian is a little rusty &#x2013; so I&apos;ll go for a) The winner.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK. I&apos;ll reveal the answer later.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK, but now I have a question for you, Rob. Who won the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Come on! It was Germany, Neil. And they beat Lionel Messi&apos;s Argentina in the final. Both teams are among the favourites again this time, but there&apos;ll be lots of countries who <strong>fancy their chances</strong> of lifting the World Cup trophy. That means they think they are likely to succeed, even though they might not.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So you do know your football, Rob! Anyway, the final will take place in the revamped &#x2013; or much improved - Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on July 15th 2018. Did I say I was very excited? Well, I&apos;m not the only one. We asked some people what they think about the World Cup. And here are Keith and Jane describing their feelings&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Keith</strong><br>It&apos;s a four-week festival of football, isn&apos;t it? And everyone kind of <strong>gets behind</strong> their country. You also get to know about football teams in parts of the world you don&apos;t really think about very often, so it&apos;s that double-sided thing of the actual football itself - which is exciting - but also the stories that happen off the pitch as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jane</strong><br>I&apos;m really excited. I can&apos;t wait for it to start. One thing &#x2013; there&apos;s going to be great telly every night. It&apos;s great to see the <strong>underdogs</strong> that are going to come through and have a really sensational tournament. I think it&apos;s the enthusiasm of the crowds and the love of football that people have.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So two football fans there. Keith used some good alliteration &#x2013; that&apos;s words beginning with the same letter &#x2013; four-week festival of fun. He talked about people <strong>getting behind</strong> their country &#x2013; not literally going behind their team, but supporting them. Who are you supporting, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, my home team is England &#x2013; but I&apos;m not confident they&apos;ll do well. That doesn&apos;t matter to Jane though &#x2013; she said it&apos;s fun to see the <strong>underdogs</strong> do well. The <strong>underdog</strong> here means the team considered to be the weakest and the least likely to win. You could say Iceland are the <strong>underdogs</strong> in this tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Maybe, Rob. So you can see why everyone is excited by the World Cup!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Not everyone, Neil. For many people, they&apos;re not bothered by the tournament. We could say &apos;it&apos;s not their thing&apos; and there are different reasons for it. Let&apos;s hear from some other people - Jeff and Inga&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong><br>There&apos;s not a lot of <strong>sportsmanship</strong> in it now. I find that it&apos;s very corporate and there&apos;s a lot of what I would call cheating going on &#x2013; people taking dives, people falling over because somebody looked at them the wrong way on the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>Inga</strong><br>Not really that excited. It&apos;s just too much <strong>hype</strong> about nothing really. The World Cup is a great event if you are into football, but I&apos;m not so I can&apos;t be really bothered.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>There you go, Neil. Some sensible people there! Jeff thinks football has changed and now lacks real <strong>sportsmanship</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s fair and honest behaviour &#x2013; he even claims some players cheat.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I&apos;m not sure about that, Rob. But maybe he&apos;s right about the tournament becoming very corporate, which means it&apos;s sponsored by big companies who like to decide how the tournament is run.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>And Inga thinks there is too much <strong>hype</strong>. This means there is a lot of talk and publicity to make people interested in something. Well, there is certainly a lot of talk about the World Cup, but we have to remember it&apos;s not everybody&apos;s cup of tea!</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, it is my cup of tea, Rob. Now, can we have the answer to that question, please?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes. Earlier I said the mascot for Russia 2018 is a wolf called Zabivaka. What does his name mean in English? Was it&#x2026;<br>a) The winner<br>b) The one who scores<br>c) Fair play</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And I said a) The winner &#x2013; because football is all about winning, isn&apos;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>It&apos;s the taking part that is important, Neil. And you took part in my quiz and got it wrong. The answer is b) The one who scores. Now let&apos;s have a brief reminder of the vocabulary we&apos;ve discussed today, starting with <strong>world-class</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>That means &apos;some of the best in the world&apos;. We should see some world-class football in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>If we&apos;re watching it, Neil. Next we had <strong>fancy their chances</strong>. If someone &apos;fancies their chances&apos; they think they are likely to succeed, but they might not.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Let&apos;s move on to <strong>get behind</strong>. If we get behind someone &#x2013; like our national football team &#x2013; we support them.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Are you getting behind our national team, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Nope, I&apos;m supporting the <strong>underdog</strong> Iceland, Rob. That&apos;s a word to describe the team or person least likely to win. Next we discussed <strong>sportsmanship</strong> &#x2013; that describes fair and honest behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>And finally we talked about <strong>hype</strong> which means &apos;lots of talking and publicity to make people interested in something&apos;. Well, we&apos;ve had enough <strong>hype</strong> about the World Cup today and we&apos;re out of time.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, but don&apos;t forget to join us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for more Learning English fun. Thanks for joining us and goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Bye bye!</p></div>
