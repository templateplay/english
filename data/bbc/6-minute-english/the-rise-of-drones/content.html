<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Hello I&apos;m Rob and this is 6 Minute English &#x2013; a programme that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and some vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. Joining me today is Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello. And today we&apos;re discussing those pilotless aircraft that we seem to be hearing and reading a lot about at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>You mean drones. And yes, they are in the news quite often for good and bad reasons. They&apos;ve been used for many things from smuggling drugs, detecting water leaks and <strong>surveillance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And surveillance &#x2013; that means &#x2018;the act of carefully watching someone or something&#x2019; &#x2013; perhaps a criminal &#x2013; but also it means spying, maybe on me and you Rob? So should we be welcoming the rise of the use of drones?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, before our discussion about that &apos;takes off&apos;, we need to set today&apos;s question for you to answer, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>What are you <strong>droning on</strong> about Rob? And by that I don&apos;t mean &#x2018;flying a drone&#x2019; &#x2013; I mean &#x2018;talking too much in a very boring way&#x2019;!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Thanks Neil. Now just answer this, will you? Drones are sometimes also referred to as UAVs. So, what does UAV stand for? Is it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) Unidentified aerial vehicle<br>b) Unmanned aerial vehicle<br>c) Unaided aircraft vehicle</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, I&apos;m going to go for b) unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Ok well, we&apos;ll see if you&apos;re right later on. Now let&apos;s talk more about drones, which, apparently, seem to be everywhere now.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>But are they safe and are they necessary? I&apos;ve heard about them being a hazard to aircraft because they&apos;ve been flown close to airports.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, figures in 2016 showed that in the UK there were 70 near misses involving drones. And that&apos;s more than double the year before. So that is a little worrying.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes. And there&apos;s the potential risk of people&apos;s privacy being invaded when a drone is flown over their property with a camera attached to it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Ah, but those cameras are also good at capturing some great <strong>aerial footage</strong> &#x2013; that&apos;s the film recording of the view from the above the ground. So they&apos;re not all bad. And Dr Yoge Patel would agree. She is CEO of Blue Bear, which supplies unmanned planes and drones. Here she is speaking about drones on the BBC&apos;s Woman&apos;s Hour programme&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Dr Yoge Patel, CEO of Blue Bear</strong><br>They have the potential to be dangerous, agreed. They also have though, on the flip side, the ability to be a <strong>game changer</strong> in both domestic use and in military use. So, some of our drones are being used for aircraft inspections. We&apos;ve put our drones into Fukushima.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>So there you go Neil. There are many useful things drones can do, and Dr Patel said they have the ability to be a game changer.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And by that you mean &#x2018;something that completely changes the way something is done or thought about&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes. Her company has used drones to inspect the inside of the damaged Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan. And another example of drones being a game changer is UNICEF and the Malawian government testing drones for carrying medical supplies. This could help save lives in remote places.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And I have read that in Australia, lifeguards are using drones to help rescue swimmers who get in trouble in the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>And have you heard about a Japanese firm that&apos;s planning to use a drone to force employees out of their offices by playing music at them if they stay to work evening overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I haven&apos;t, but you&apos;ve convinced me &#x2013; it seems like <strong>the sky&apos;s the limit</strong> for the uses of drones! I mean there&apos;s no limit to what they can do. But I am a little concerned about how they are regulated or controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well Dr Yoge Patel says because the technology is new, regulations &#x2013; or legal controls - are developing all the time&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Dr Yoge Patel, CEO, Blue Bear</strong><br>As technology progresses, regulation and operational use needs to then be <strong>harmonised</strong> with it. And we are, as a community, going through that whole process of saying what is proportionate and appropriate regulation to go with different uses of drones.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So she talked about regulations being harmonised as technology progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>So I think she means &#x2018;making regulations suitable and appropriate for what the drones are being used for&#x2019;. So they need some control, but not so they can&apos;t be useful and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Like flying drones to stop you working late! Now Rob, I&apos;m dying to know what the other name for a drone is.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK, let me tell you. So earlier I asked what does UAV stand for? Was it&#x2026;</p>
<p>a) Unidentified aerial vehicle<br>b) Unmanned aerial vehicle<br>c) Unaided aircraft vehicle</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And I said b) &#x2013; was that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes Neil, you know your drones &#x2013; that&apos;s correct. Well done. UAVs or drones have been around for quite a while in different forms. It&apos;s thought they were first used for providing practice targets for training military personnel. OK Neil, let&apos;s quickly go over some of the vocabulary we have mentioned today, starting with surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>&quot;The police kept the jewellery shop under surveillance because they had a tip-off about a robbery.&quot; So that means &#x2018;carefully watching someone or something, usually to try to stop something illegal&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Then we mentioned aerial footage &#x2013; that&apos;s film recording made from the sky. &quot;The aerial footage on TV of the dolphins swimming was spectacular.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, drones have been a game changer for wildlife programmes on TV. That means &#x2018;something that completely changes the way something is done or thought about&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>We also mentioned the phrase &apos;the sky&apos;s the limit&apos;, meaning &#x2018;there&apos;s no limit to something&#x2019;. &quot;The sky is the limit to what professional footballers can earn these days.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Then we discussed harmonised &#x2013; that describes two things being suitable for each other to allow them to work properly. &quot;The garden has been designed to harmonise with the natural landscape.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Very useful vocabulary, Neil. But let&apos;s stop droning on &#x2013; and that means &#x2018;talking too much in a boring way&#x2019; - and remind everyone to check out our You Tube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages &#x2013; and of course, our website at bbclearningenglish.com. See you next time. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Goodbye</p></div>
