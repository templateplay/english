<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Alice&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Did I see you arriving in a huge red pick-up truck this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes &#x2013; it&apos;s great, isn&apos;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>It&apos;s very big&#x2026; and red. But Rob, aren&apos;t you a supporter of the movement to preserve the environment?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Erm&#x2026; Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>A gas-guzzling car for an environmentalist, Rob? Isn&apos;t that a contradiction &#x2013; aren&apos;t you being a hypocrite?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, it&apos;s very fuel-efficient, Alice. It&apos;s quite eco-friendly actually.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>That&apos;s ridiculous and you know it. Hypocrisy is the subject of today&apos;s show, and maybe we should start by exploring the meaning of hypocrite. Can you tell me what did the Ancient Greek word &#x2018;hypocrite&apos; originally mean? Was it&#x2026;<br>a) actor<br>b) politician<br>Or c) horse?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, that&apos;s easy. I think it&apos;s b) politician.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we&apos;ll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. Now, these days the meaning has changed, and a <strong>hypocrite</strong> means somebody who says one thing and does another.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Like you telling me not to bite my nails because it&apos;s a disgusting habit&#x2026; and then I see you doing it later the same day.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Hmm. Well, sometimes it&apos;s hard to be consistent. I do think nail biting is disgusting &#x2013; but then when I&apos;m a bit nervous I do it without thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>We&apos;re often inconsistent in what we say or do, though, aren&apos;t we? <strong>Inconsistent</strong> means changeable.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>There is an explanation for us sometimes saying one thing and behaving in a very different way. Let&apos;s listen to Professor Clancy Martin at the University of Missouri in the US. He teaches Philosophy so he knows a thing or two about the way we think.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br></strong>So while you might be enormously compassionate in your role as a teacher or a parent, you might find yourself being quite harsh and direct when it comes to your role as a brother or a sister. So then you see that - now wait a second if I&apos;ve got all these inconsistencies all over the place in my character can I really say that I&apos;m a sincere and authentic individual? Or am I just kind of blowing with which ever way my relationship winds kind of incline me?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Professor Clancy Martin. So we play different roles in life and these roles may seem contradictory but they&apos;re just part of being the same person. Sometimes you&apos;re a bit harsh and direct with me, Alice, aren&apos;t you? Do you see yourself as my sister? She used to pick on me.<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Harsh </strong>means stern and unkind. I don&apos;t mean to be unkind to you, Rob. Maybe I could try and be more <strong>compassionate</strong> towards you &#x2013; it means show a bit of sympathy and concern now and then.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Offer me good words. At least promise you&apos;ll be nice to me. That you&apos;ll bring me tea and biscuits&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>That&apos;s what politicians do. They promise they will do what people want and &#x2026; often they don&apos;t. And it&apos;s a big problem for them. Let&apos;s talk about politicians and hypocrisy.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>They have to express opinions about so many things that it&apos;s easy to catch them out being hypocritical&#x2026; &#x2013; and then we, the public, get morally indignant about it.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. To <strong>catch somebody out</strong> means to discover they have made a mistake. And <strong>morally indignant</strong> means being angry about something, according to principles of right and wrong. Let&apos;s listen to Professor Martin again talking about the difficulties of being a politician.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br></strong>I think in our contemporary democracy it&apos;s become obvious to most of us that the views that we expect from our politicians and the kinds of views that get our politicians elected are&#x2026; may be completely incongruous with the way they lead their personal lives and what they personally believe. And this is how it can become very morally pernicious&#x2026; very morally dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>OK, so we elect politicians based on their views &#x2013; for example on the environment, on education, on foreign policy. But their public views may be <strong>incongruous</strong> &#x2013; or not in agreement with &#x2013; their personal views.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And the difference between their public and personal views can be <strong>pernicious</strong> - it means deadly or destructive.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Politicians are under scrutiny all the time &#x2013; their personal lives, their public statements... Now with social media, a thoughtless comment <strong>goes viral</strong> &#x2013; or spreads very quickly via the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>That&apos;s true. And actually&#x2026; I posted a photo of my red pick-up truck earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Has it gone viral, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>No, but there is a negative comment from the local conservationists&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh dear. Well, Rob, I think it&apos;s time I told you the answer to today&apos;s quiz question. I asked: What did the Ancient Greek word &apos;hypocrite&apos; originally describe? Was it&#x2026; a) actor, b) politician or c) horse.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And I said b) politician.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were wrong, I&apos;m afraid! <em>Hypokrites</em> was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens in the 4th century BC, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed a rival politician, who had been a successful actor. Well, we&apos;re running out of time so can we hear the words we learned today?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>They are:<br>hypocrite<br>inconsistent<br>harsh<br>compassionate<br>catch somebody out<br>morally indignant<br>incongruous<br>pernicious<br>go viral</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that&apos;s the end of today&apos;s 6 Minute English. Don&apos;t forget to join us again soon!</p>
<p><strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.</p></div>
