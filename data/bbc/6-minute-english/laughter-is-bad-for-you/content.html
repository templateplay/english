<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English with me, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Neil, I&apos;m going to tell you a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Which part of learning the English language are boxers best at?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Which part of English are boxers best at?&#xA0; I don&apos;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Punch-uation (punctuation).</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That&apos;s actually quite funny.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I do, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, I&apos;m glad I made you laugh. But you might not thank me for it after the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Why&apos;s that?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Because a paper published by the British Medical Journal says that laughter is not always the best medicine, and sometimes, it can actually be harmful.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, in that case I definitely won&apos;t be laughing at your jokes any more! And, to be honest, it wasn&apos;t funny anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Anyway, today we&apos;ll be exploring the connection between laughter and health, and looking at some health-related vocabulary. But before we get into the story, Neil: a question. You&apos;re a parent. At what age do babies begin to laugh? Is it:</p>
<p>a) 0-3 months</p>
<p>b) 3-6 months</p>
<p>c) 6-8 months</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right I&apos;m pretty sure, unless my memory is very bad, that it&apos;s a) 0-3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, well, we will find out if you&apos;re right at the end of the programme. OK, so laughter, as I said, is generally thought of as a good thing. There&apos;s a phrase I said earlier which is: <strong style="font-size: 12px;">laughter is the best medicine</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, and talking of medicine, there are many medical studies which examine the benefits of laughter - it reduces stress, it&apos;s good for your heart, things like that. But now you&apos;re telling me it can have some negative effects?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, why don&apos;t we listen to Professor Robin Ferner, who is one of the authors of the research paper. How many negative effects of laughter does he mention?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br clear="none"></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear="none"></strong>We found people with heart rhythm disturbance which had stopped their heart, we found people who had fainted, we found people whose gullets had burst, we found people who&apos;d dislocated their jaws or burst their lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Quite a few! It seems laughing can be<strong style="font-size: 12px;"> no laughing matter!</strong><strong style="font-size: 12px;">&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Indeed - he mentions five problems caused by laughter, including heart rhythm disturbance, fainting, burst gullets, dislocated jaws and even burst lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Some of those sound quite nasty.<strong style="font-size: 12px;"> Fainting</strong> is when you lose consciousness and pass out; and your<strong style="font-size: 12px;"> gullet</strong> is the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach, so a burst gullet would be horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I think it would be very bad! We also heard about burst <strong style="font-size: 12px;">lungs</strong> - lungs are the organs in your chest that you use to breathe. And - I think you&apos;d have to be laughing really hard to do this - to get a <strong style="font-size: 12px;">dislocated jaw</strong>. To dislocate something is to move it out of its normal place or position, so you dis-locate it. A dislocated jaw - ouch.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, thankfully there is no danger of dislocated jaws with your jokes Finn!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>OK! Well, in fact, these five dangers are only some that were mentioned in the study.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But surely, there must have been some positive findings?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, let&apos;s listen to Professor Robin Ferner again - which health benefit does he mention?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br clear="none"></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear="none"></strong>You actually use energy when you laugh, you move your diaphragm, you expand your lungs, and both those things can be helpful. For example, it&apos;s said that laughing for quarter of an hour will burn up 40 kcal, and if you laughed all day you&apos;d use up about 2,000 calories.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That&apos;s more like it! Laughing can help you lose weight, because you use energy when you laugh.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>In fact, quite a lot of energy: if you laughed all day you&apos;d use 2,000 calories, which is what most people consume in a day.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He also thinks laughing makes people feel better, and it can reduce the chance of having a <strong style="font-size: 12px;">heart attack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So overall - what&apos;s the story - laughing: good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, he says for most people, most of the time, laughing is a great thing. And well, that&apos;s good, because I like to laugh, don&apos;t you Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Earlier I asked you Neil, at what age do babies begin to laugh? Was it 0-3 months, 3-6 months or 6-8 months?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said 0-3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, Neil, the answer was in fact b) 3-6 months. A little bit later! And 0-3 months, which was your answer, Neil, is when babies smile for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you <strong style="font-size: 12px;">had the last laugh</strong> there Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Very good - and if you have the last laugh it means you&apos;re successful in the end. Right, that&apos;s it for this programme. Do log on to bbclearningenglish.com for more 6 Minute English. Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Bye.</p></div>
