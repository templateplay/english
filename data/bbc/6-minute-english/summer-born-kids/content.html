<p>If a child is born in the summer, their parents could delay their start of school by up to a year. That would be the effect of a proposal made by a UK Minister who wishes&#xA0;to change school admissions. Listen in to Rob and Neil to find out if the proposal is likely to solve the problem - and learn some related vocabulary at the same time!</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I&apos;m Rob&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>&#x2026; and I&apos;m Neil. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Well Neil I&apos;ve got a question for you straight away. Were you a summer baby? Were you born in the summer?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Um&#x2026;Yes, I was actually. Late summer.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK. And did you go to university?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes&#x2026;? Strange questions here, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Not really. My questions do make sense because we&apos;re talking about the impact when you were born has on how well you perform at school.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK. Are you calling me stupid here, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Nothing like that. Well maybe&#x2026; let&apos;s wait and see what the experts have to say. But before that, I&apos;ve got another question for you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK then &#x2013; let&apos;s see if I&apos;m clever enough to answer it!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK. Well, based on birth records between 1973 and 1999, what is the most common birthday for a person in the United States? Is it:</p>
<p>a) 1st January</p>
<p>b) 16th September</p>
<p>c) 30th March</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>I&apos;m gonna guess 30th March.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK. Well, we&apos;ll hear the answer at the end of the programme. Another question now. According to research, are summer born babies <strong>more likely</strong> or <strong>less likely</strong> to go to university?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, we are going to hear from an expert. Lorraine Dearden, who is Professor of Economics and Social Statistics at University College London (UCL). She was interviewed by the BBC about summer-born babies. She talks about the research, how well do they do in tests. How do they <strong>perform</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Professor Lorraine Dearden, University College London</strong><br>All the research has shown that summer born kids perform much worse in tests right through up until the age of eighteen and even &#x2026; they&apos;re less likely to attend <strong>higher education</strong>.<br><strong>BBC interviewer</strong><br>I mean, these are <strong>startling</strong> statistics 20% are less likely to go to university.<br><strong>Professor Lorraine Dearden, University College London</strong><br>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>That was Professor Lorraine Deardon with some really really surprising statistics &#x2013; startling statistics, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, she says summer born kids perform much worse in tests.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, these summer born kids perform worse at school right through until the age of eighteen when they might be thinking about going to university.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, university. That&apos;s higher education.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>So the professor said, according to research, summer babies are less likely to go to university - 20% in fact.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Really? Well, don&#x2019;t forget Rob, I told you I&apos;m a summer baby. Well, I went to university.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes, of course. These are just <strong>statistics</strong> &#x2013; just figures. But if you are a parent of a child starting school these statistics are worrying.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well they shouldn&apos;t worry. There are lots of people who were born in the summer that have done very well at university, thank you. And some of them are now professors.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>OK. Or BBC presenters&#x2026; like you Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, like me. But here is the problem. Let&apos;s say you have a child. He&apos;s a boy, born in August. He&apos;s now 4 years old so he can start school this September. But in his class there are students whose birthday is coming very soon so they&#x2019;re going to be 5 &#x2013; that&apos;s almost a year older than your child.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>So parents want their kids to do well at school &#x2013; they are concerned - and now the government is trying to help &#x2013; they&apos;re trying to <strong>address</strong> those <strong>concerns</strong>. England&apos;s schools minister Nick Gibbs says that the government wants to change the <strong>admissions</strong> rules for schools.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>The rule now in much of England is that children must start school in September after their fourth birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>The schools minister says these rules should be changed. &quot;Parents know their children best,&quot; said Mr Gibb.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Parents don&apos;t want to send their children to school before they are ready.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>So here is the proposal &#x2013; or suggested new rules. If a child is born in the summer, parents could <strong>delay</strong> the child&apos;s start of school by up to a year.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So the child will start school at 5 years old. Great, but does our expert Professor Lorraine Deardon think that&apos;s a good idea. Is this the way to address the problem of the age difference?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Professor Lorraine Deardon, University College London</strong><br>Ah no, it&apos;s not. I mean, basically, the reason why these children do worse in tests right throughout their life is simply that they are up to a year younger than their September born colleagues and this does nothing to address this.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Professor Lorraine Deardon. She says that the new <strong>policy</strong> does nothing to address the problem of the age difference.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>There are still going to be 4 year olds in the class. Perhaps there will be more 5 year olds now because parents can delay their child&apos;s start at school.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, the new policy addresses the concerns of parents that their children are not ready for school at 4 years old&#x2026;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>&#x2026; but there will always be this age difference in a classroom and many of the younger children will do worse in tests. Professor Deardon says that the proposal to change the schools admission policy does nothing to address this.</p>
<p>OK, time now for the answer to the question I set you at the beginning of the programme. I asked: based on birth records between 1973 and 1999, what is the most common birthday for a person in the United States? Is it:</p>
<p>a) 1st January</p>
<p>b) 16th September</p>
<p>c) 30th March</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And I guessed the 30th March.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>But you are wrong I&apos;m afraid. The answer is actually the 16th September. Happy birthday to whoever was born then anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Yeah. OK, Rob. Can you tell us the words we learned today again please?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>Of course. We heard:</p>
<p>more likely / less likely</p>
<p>perform</p>
<p>higher education</p>
<p>startling</p>
<p>statistics</p>
<p>admissions</p>
<p>delay</p>
<p>policy</p>
<p>concerns</p>
<p>address the problem</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, that&apos;s the end of 6 Minute English. Please do join us again soon.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong><br>Bye.</p></div>
