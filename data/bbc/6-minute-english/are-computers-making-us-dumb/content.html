<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, I&apos;m Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hi. Hi Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Are you alright, Neil? Are you playing on your <strong>smartphone</strong> again, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Err... what was that? Yeah, sorry, Rob... just doing something on my smartphone, you know, the kind of phone which allows you to go online.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh I can see that. But are you waiting for a call?<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No. No, I just carry it with me at all times. Where I go, the phone goes. No phone, no Neil!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>OK, but why do you need your phone so much?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Why?! What if I need to need to go somewhere? How will I find my way? What about the weather? Will it rain today? I need to know these things.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Why don&apos;t you just look up in the sky and see if it is cloudy?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Look up to see if it is going to rain?! I have an <strong>app</strong> - which is short for an application, which is a computer programme for a specific purpose. My app tells me the weather... and this one does all the maths I need... and here&apos;s one for translations, and this one here... can tell me what I&apos;m going to...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, OK, OK, I get the point. Today we&apos;re talking about computers - and we&apos;ll bring you some words <strong>connected</strong> with the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Connected - <strong>to connect</strong> - we use this verb a lot. It means &apos;to link, or join, one thing to another thing. In this case, connected means &apos;linked to the internet&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, I can see you are very excited about computers. So that&apos;s what my question is all about. The first commercially produced &quot;desktop computer&quot; was designed and produced by the Italian company Olivetti and presented at an event in New York. When did it happen? Was it in:</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>a)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1955</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>b)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1965 or</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>c)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1975<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I think it&apos;s (a) 1955.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Very interesting. You&apos;ll get the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let&apos;s talk about computers. You can&apos;t live without them but American technology writer Nicholas Carr, the author of a book called &apos;The Glass Cage - where automation is taking us&apos;, thinks they might cause problems.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Problems?! They cause us problems when they <strong>crash</strong> - that&apos;s what we say when our computer suddenly stops working.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, not just that. Let&apos;s listen to Nicholas Carr. He says if we rely too much on computers we lose something. But what is it?</p>
<p><strong>American technology writer Nicholas Carr<br></strong><em>The ability of computers to do things we used to do is growing astronomically and we&apos;re rushing to hand over to computers tasks, activities - both in our work lives and in our personal lives - and what you begin to see is what is often called a <strong>de-skilling</strong> effect. The person becoming reliant on computers; because they are not exercising their own <strong>talents</strong>, those talents begin to fade. And we begin to lose, as a result, the unique things that human beings can do that computers can&apos;t: feel <strong>empathy</strong>, take a broad perspective, interpret all the stuff that can&apos;t be turned into data.</em></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>According to Nicholas Carr, using computers means that we are losing skills - he talks about &apos;de-skilling&apos;. A skill is the ability to do something well because we&apos;ve practised it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And he also talks about the loss of talent - talent is a natural ability to do something - you didn&apos;t have to learn it, you&apos;re just naturally good at it. It&apos;s something we&apos;re all born with. Carr says that relying on computers means our talent is fading because we don&apos;t use it any more.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And he goes even further and says we&apos;re losing some of the things that make us human, like empathy, the ability to imagine and understand what other people might be feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>So, do you agree with this writer, Neil?&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br> </strong>I think he&apos;s got a point actually.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>It&apos;s like the friendships we make on social media. It is nice to get to know new people in different countries, but we have to remember that it&apos;s important to talk to people face-to-face too.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So... maybe we shouldn&apos;t use <strong>GPS</strong> to find our way around all the time. GPS, the global positioning system which gives us directions with the help of satellites orbiting the Earth... instead, have a conversation with someone - ask for directions.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and perhaps we can give the <strong>spellchecker</strong> a miss occasionally. A spellchecker is a very useful piece of software which helps us avoid making spelling mistakes when we&apos;re typing on a computer but... it is good to actually learn how to spell the words properly and not leave everything to the machine.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Good idea, Rob. I&apos;ll try not to rely so much on digital technology. Computers are here to stay and they&apos;ll become more and more sophisticated, but we have to remember they are just tools.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, computers are here to stay. And by the way, when was the first commercially produced &quot;desktop computer&quot; launched? As I told you, it was designed and created by Olivetti and launched in New York. But when was it launched? Was it: 1955, 1965 or 1975?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said 1955.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Perhaps you should ask your smartphone because the correct answer is actually (b) 1965.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I don&apos;t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>The computer was called Programma 101 and it was presented at the New York World&apos;s Fair. They sold 44,000 units all over the world. The initial price in the US was US$ 3,200. Well, we are almost out of time so let&apos;s remind ourselves of some of the words we said today, Neil.</p>
