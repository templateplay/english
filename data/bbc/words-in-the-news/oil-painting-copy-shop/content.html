<p>Millions of <strong>replicas</strong> of Van Goghs, Monets, and Picassos are exported, generating billions in <strong>revenue</strong> for these painters who were once farmers or migrant workers.</p>
<p>But because of online competition, these artists are starting to concentrate on producing <strong>original</strong> pieces of art.</p>
