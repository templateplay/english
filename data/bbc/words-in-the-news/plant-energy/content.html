<p>Could your garden <strong>power</strong> your mobile phone?</p>
<p>Scientists at Cambridge University are <strong>investigating</strong> how plants can give us <strong>sustainable energy</strong>.</p>
<p>They do this by collecting <strong>electrons</strong> released naturally by plants and turning them into electricity. You can even create your own algae <strong>solar panel</strong>.</p>
<p>But a lot of work needs to be done to make the process more efficient.</p>
<h3><strong>Vocabulary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>power (verb) <br> </strong>provide energy to make something work</p>
<p><strong>investigating<br> </strong>researching</p>
<p><strong>sustainable energy<br> </strong>energy created from sources that will not run out, such as wind and the sun</p>
<p><strong>electrons<br> </strong>tiny parts of atoms that move round the atom&apos;s centre and have a negative electrical charge</p>
<p><strong>solar panel<br> </strong>a piece of equipment that changes energy from the sun into electricity</p>
